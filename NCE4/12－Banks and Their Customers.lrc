[00:02.26]Banks and their customers | 银行及其储户
[00:07.92]Why is there no risk to the customer when a bank prints the customer's name on his cheques? | 当银行在顾客支票上印上顾客姓名时，顾客为什么没有任何风险？
[00:15.50]When anyone opens a current account at a bank, he is lending the bank money, | 任何人在银行开立活期账户，他就是在借钱给银行，
[00:20.69]repayment of which he may demand at any time either in cash or by drawing a cheque in favour of another person. | 而他可以随时要求银行偿还这笔钱，方式可以是现金，也可以是开出支票给另一个人。
[00:29.28]Primarily, the banker-customer relationship is that of debtor and creditor-- | 银行和储户的关系主要是债务人和债权人的关系——
[00:35.26]who is which depending on whether the customer's account is in credit or is overdrawn. | 谁是债务人，谁是债权人，取决于储户的账户是盈余还是透支。
[00:40.53]But, in addition to that basically simple concept, | 但是，除了这个基本简单的概念之外，
[00:43.76]the bank and its customer owe a large number of obligations to one another. | 银行和其储户彼此还负有大量的义务。
[00:49.72]Many of these obligations can give rise to problems and complications but a bank customer, unlike, say, a buyer of goods, | 这些义务中的许多都可能引起问题和复杂情况，但是银行储户，不像（比如说）商品购买者，
[00:58.87]cannot complain that the law is loaded against him. | 不能抱怨法律对他不利。
[01:02.59]The bank must obey its customer's instructions, and not those of anyone else. | 银行必须服从其储户的指令，而不是其他任何人的指令。
[01:07.79]When, for example, a customer first opens an account, he instructs the bank to debit his account only in respect of cheques drawn by himself. | 例如，当储户首次开立账户时，他会指示银行只对由他本人开出的支票进行借记。
[01:17.88]He gives the bank specimens of his signature, and there is a very firm rule | 他向银行提供他的签名样本，并且有一条非常明确的规定：
[01:22.82]that the bank has no right or authority to pay out a customer's money on a cheque | 银行无权或无权限根据一张支票支付储户的款项，
[01:27.94]on which its customer's signature has been forged. | 如果这张支票上的储户签名被伪造。
[01:31.90]It makes no difference that the forgery may have been a very skillful one: | 即使伪造得非常高明，也没有任何区别：
[01:36.48]the bank must recognize its customer's signature. | 银行必须识别其储户的签名。
[01:40.24]For this reason there is no risk to the customer in the practice, adopted by banks, of printing the customer's name on his cheques. | 由于这个原因，银行采用的在储户支票上印上储户姓名的做法对储户来说没有风险。
[01:49.00]If this facilitates forgery, it is the bank which will lose, not the customer. | 如果这有助于伪造，那么损失的是银行，而不是储户。
