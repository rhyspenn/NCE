[00:02.50]Planning a share portfolio | 规划股票投资组合
[00:10.35]How does the older investor differ in his approach to investment from the younger investor? | 较年长的投资者在投资方式上与年轻投资者有何不同？
[00:19.17]There is no shortage of tipsters around offering 'get-rich-quick' opportunities. | 身边不乏提供“快速致富”机会的内幕消息者。
[00:24.88]But if you are a serious private investor, leave the Las Vegas mentality to those with money to fritter. | 但如果你是一个认真的私人投资者，就把那种拉斯维加斯的心态留给那些有钱可挥霍的人吧。
[00:32.41]The serious investor needs a proper 'portfolio' --a well-planned selection of investments, with a definite structure and a clear aim. | 认真的投资者需要一个合适的“投资组合”——一个精心策划的投资选择，具有明确的结构和清晰的目标。
[00:41.88]But exactly how does a newcomer to the stock market go about achieving that? | 但股市新手究竟如何才能做到这一点呢？
[00:48.15]Well, if you go to five reputable stock brokers and ask them what you should do with your money, | 嗯，如果你去找五位声誉良好的股票经纪人，问他们你该如何处理你的钱，
[00:54.44]you're likely to get five different answers, | 你很可能会得到五种不同的答案，
[00:57.32]-- even if you give all the relevant information about your age, family, finances and what you want from your investments. | ——即使你提供了所有关于你的年龄、家庭、财务状况以及你希望从投资中获得什么的相关信息。
[01:05.48]Moral? There is no one 'right' way to structure a portfolio. | 结论？没有一个“正确”的方法来构建投资组合。
[01:10.44]However, there are undoubtedly some wrong ways, and you can be sure that none of our five advisers | 然而，无疑有一些错误的方法，你可以肯定，我们的五位顾问中没有一人会
[01:17.23]would have suggested sinking all (or perhaps any) of your money into Periwigs. | 建议你把所有（或者说任何）钱投入到Periwigs公司。
[01:23.36]So what should you do? | 那么你该怎么做呢？
[01:25.21]We'll assume that you have sorted out the basics--like mortgages, pensions, insurance and access to sufficient cash reserves. | 我们假设你已经解决了基本问题——比如抵押贷款、养老金、保险和拥有足够的现金储备。
[01:34.00]You should then establish your own individual aims. | 然后你应该确立自己的个人目标。
[01:37.56]These are partly a matter of personal circumstances, partly a matter of psychology. | 这些部分取决于个人情况，部分取决于心理因素。
[01:43.67]For instance, if you are older you have less time to recover from any major losses, and you may well wish to boost your pension income. | 例如，如果你年龄较大，从任何重大损失中恢复的时间较短，而且你很可能希望增加你的养老金收入。
[01:53.09]So preserving your capital and generating extra income are your main priorities. | 因此，保住你的本金并获得额外收入是你的主要优先事项。
[01:59.36]In this case, you'd probably construct a portfolio with some shares (but not high risk ones), along with gilts, cash deposits, | 在这种情况下，你可能会构建一个包含一些股票（但不是高风险的）、政府债券、现金存款、
[02:09.00]and perhaps convertibles or the income shares of split capital investment trusts. | 也许还有可转换债券或分级资本投资信托的收益股的投资组合。
[02:15.11]If you are younger, and in a solid financial position, | 如果你比较年轻，且财务状况稳健，
[02:19.49]you may decide to take an aggressive approach--but only if you're blessed with a sanguine disposition and won't suffer sleepless nights over share prices. | 你可能会决定采取激进的策略——但前提是你拥有乐观的性格，并且不会因为股价而彻夜难眠。
[02:29.68]If you recognize yourself in this description, | 如果你认为自己符合这个描述，
[02:32.72]you might include a couple of heady growth stocks in your portfolio, alongside your more pedestrian investments. | 你可以在你的投资组合中加入几只涨势强劲的成长股，以及一些更稳健的投资。
[02:40.96]Once you have decided on your investment aims you can then decide where to put your money. | 一旦你确定了你的投资目标，你就可以决定把钱投到哪里。
[02:47.65]The golden rule here is spread your risk--if you put all of your money into Periwigs International, | 这里的黄金法则是分散风险——如果你把所有钱都投入到Periwigs国际公司，
[02:55.44]you're setting yourself up as a hostage to fortune. | 你就是在把自己置于命运的摆布之下。
