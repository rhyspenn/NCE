[00:00.95]Lesson 46 | 第46课
[00:02.93]Hobbies | 爱好
[00:09.56]Who, according to the author, are 'Fortune's favoured children'? | 依作者看，谁是“命运的宠儿”？
[00:16.63]A gifted American psychologist has said, 'Worry is a spasm of the emotion; | 一位才华出众的美国心理学家说过：“忧虑是感情的一种痉挛；
[00:23.02]the mind catches hold of something and will not let it go.' | 思想一旦抓住了某件事就不会松手。”
[00:27.45]It is useless to argue with the mind in this condition. | 在这种情况下，跟思想进行争辩是无济于事的。
[00:30.89]The stronger the will, the more futile the task. | 意志越坚强，任务就越徒劳。
[00:34.54]One can only gently insinuate something else into its convulsive grasp. | 人只能轻轻地向其痉挛的掌控中渗入其他东西。
[00:39.98]And if this something else is rightly chosen, if it is really attended by the illumination of another field of interest, | 如果这种“其他东西”选择得当，如果它确实伴随着另一个兴趣领域的启迪，
[00:48.31]gradually, and often quite swiftly, the old undue grip relaxes and the process of recuperation and repair begins. | 那么，旧有的不当掌控就会逐渐（而且往往是相当迅速地）放松，恢复和修复的过程就会开始。
[00:59.30]The cultivation of a hobby and new forms of interest is therefore a policy of the first importance to a public man. | 因此，培养爱好和新的兴趣形式对公众人物来说是首要的策略。
[01:07.87]But this is not a business that can be undertaken in a day or swiftly improvised by a mere command of the will. | 但这不是一天就能完成的，也不是单凭意志命令就能迅速凑成的。
[01:15.76]The growth of alternative mental interests is a long process. | 培养替代性精神兴趣是一个漫长的过程。
[01:20.65]The seeds must be carefully chosen; they must fall on good ground; | 种子必须精心挑选；它们必须落在好土壤里；
[01:25.47]they must be sedulously tended, if the vivifying fruits are to be at hand when needed. | 它们必须勤勉照料，才能在需要时结出充满生机的果实。
[01:32.62]To be really happy and really safe, one ought to have at least two or three hobbies, and they must all be real. | 要真正快乐和真正安全，一个人至少应该有两三个爱好，而且它们都必须是真实的。
[01:40.91]It is no use starting late in life to say: 'I will take an interest in this or that.' | 在晚年才开始说：“我会对这个或那个感兴趣。”是没用的。
[01:46.63]Such an attempt only aggravates the strain of mental effort. | 这种尝试只会加剧精神努力的负担。
[01:51.36]A man may acquire great knowledge of topics unconnected with his daily work, and yet get hardly any benefit or relief. | 一个人可能对与日常工作无关的话题获得渊博的知识，但却几乎得不到任何益处或解脱。
[02:00.13]It is no use doing what you like; you have got to like what you do. | 做你喜欢的事情是没有用的；你必须喜欢你所做的事情。
[02:04.74]Broadly speaking, human beings may be divided into three classes: | 广义上说，人类可以分为三类：
[02:10.27]those who are toiled to death, those who are worried to death, and those who are bored to death. | 那些劳累致死的人，那些忧虑致死的人，以及那些无聊致死的人。
[02:18.48]It is no use offering the manual labourer, | 向体力劳动者提供，
[02:22.04]tired out with a hard week's sweat and effort the chance of playing a game of football or baseball on Saturday afternoon. | 一个星期辛苦劳作、筋疲力尽的人，在周六下午打一场足球或棒球比赛的机会是没有用的。
[02:29.96]It is no use inviting the politician or the professional or business man, who has been working or worrying about serious things for six days, | 邀请一个已经工作或为严肃的事情担忧了六天的政治家、专业人士或商人，
[02:39.87]to work or worry about trifling things at the weekend. | 在周末去为琐碎的事情工作或担忧是没有用的。
[02:44.75]As for the unfortunate people who can command everything they want, | 至于那些能得到他们想要的一切的不幸之人，
[02:49.53]who can gratify every caprice and lay their hands on almost every object of desire--for them a new pleasure a new excitement is only an additional satiation. | 那些能满足每一个任性要求，几乎能得到所有渴望之物的人——对他们来说，新的快乐，新的兴奋只是一种额外的满足。
[03:02.40]In vain they rush frantically round from place to place, trying to escape from avenging boredom by mere clatter and motion. | 他们徒劳地从一个地方狂奔到另一个地方，试图通过喧哗和移动来逃避复仇般的无聊。
[03:11.88]For them discipline in one form or another is the most hopeful path. | 对他们来说，某种形式的纪律才是最有希望的道路。
[03:18.49]It may also be said that rational, industrious, useful human beings are divided into two classes: | 也可以说，理智、勤劳、有用的人类分为两类：
[03:26.14]first, those whose work is work and whose pleasure is pleasure; | 第一类，工作是工作，娱乐是娱乐；
[03:31.20]and secondly, those whose work and pleasure are one. | 第二类，工作和娱乐合二为一。
[03:35.49]Of these the former are the majority. They have their compensations. | 其中，前者是大多数。他们有他们的补偿。
[03:40.40]The long hours in the office or the factory bring with them as their reward, | 办公室或工厂里的长时间工作带给他们的回报，
[03:45.46]not only the means of sustenance, but a keen appetite for pleasure even in its simplest and most modest forms. | 不仅是维持生计的手段，而且是对即使是最简单、最朴素的乐趣的强烈渴望。
[03:53.80]But Fortune's favoured children belong to the second class. | 但命运的宠儿属于第二类。
[03:58.17]Their life is a natural harmony. | 他们的生活是自然的和谐。
[04:01.28]For them the working hours are never long enough. | 对他们来说，工作时间永远不够长。
[04:04.92]Each day is a holiday, and ordinary holidays, when they come, are grudged as enforced interruptions in an absorbing vocation. | 每天都是节日，而普通的假期，当它们到来时，却被视为对一个引人入胜的职业的强制性打断而感到不快。
[04:15.26]Yet to both classes, the need of an alternative outlook, of a change of atmosphere of a diversion of effort, is essential. | 然而，对这两类人来说，需要一种不同的视角，一种改变氛围，一种转移精力的需求是必不可少的。
[04:25.22]Indeed, it may well be that those whose work is their pleasure are those who most need the means of banishing it at intervals from their minds. | 事实上，那些以工作为乐的人，可能最需要时时将工作从他们脑海中驱逐出去的手段。
