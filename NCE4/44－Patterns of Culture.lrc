[00:15.46]Custom has not commonly been regarded as a subject of any great moment. | 习俗通常不被认为是一个举足轻重的问题。
[00:20.81]The inner workings of our own brains we feel to be uniquely worthy of investigation, | 我们认为我们自己大脑的内部运作是独一无二地值得研究的，
[00:26.82]but custom, we have a way of thinking, is behaviour at is most commonplace. | 但我们有一种想法，认为习俗是最常见的行为。

[00:50.73]Yet that is a rather trivial aspect of the matter. | 然而，这只是问题的微不足道的一面。
[00:54.70]The fact of first-rate importance is the predominant role that custom plays in experience and in belief, | 最重要的事实是习俗在经验和信仰中扮演的主导角色，

[01:23.66]his very concepts of the true and the false will still have reference to his particular traditional customs. | 他对真与假的观念仍然会与他特定的传统习俗相关联。
[01:31.50]John Dewey has said in all seriousness that the part played by custom in shaping the behaviour of the individual, | 约翰·杜威曾非常严肃地说，习俗在塑造个人行为中所起的作用，
[01:39.36]as against any way in which he can affect traditional custom, | 与他能够影响传统习俗的任何方式相比，
[01:43.65]is as the proportion of the total vocabulary of his mother tongue | 就像他母语的全部词汇量，
[01:48.64]against those words of his own baby talk that are taken up into the vernacular of his family. | 与他自己咿呀学语中被家庭口语采纳的词语之比。
[01:56.17]When one seriously studies the social orders that have had the opportunity to develop autonomously, | 当人们认真研究那些有机会自主发展的社会秩序时，

[02:37.30]its habits are his habits, its beliefs his beliefs, its impossibilities his impossibilities. | 它的习惯是他的习惯，它的信仰是他的信仰，它的不可能之事是他的不可能之事。
[02:45.92]Every child that is born into his group will share them with him, | 每一个出生在他群体中的孩子都会与他分享这些，
[02:50.38]and no child born into one on the opposite side of the globe can ever achieve the thousandth part. | 而出生在地球另一边的孩子连千分之一也无法做到。

[03:40.88]In all the less controversial fields, like the study of cacti or termites or the nature of nebulae, | 在所有争议较少的领域，比如研究仙人掌、白蚁或星云的性质，
[03:48.21]the necessary method of study is to group the relevant material and to take note of all possible variant forms and conditions. | 必要的研究方法是将相关材料分组，并记录所有可能的变体形式和条件。
[03:56.75]In this way, we have learned all that we know of the laws of astronomy, or of the habits of the social insects, let us say. | 通过这种方式，我们掌握了天文学的所有规律，或者说，掌握了群居昆虫的习性。
