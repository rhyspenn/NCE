[00:03.12]The process of ageing | 衰老的过程
[00:11.66]What is one of the most unpleasant discoveries we make about ourselves as we get older? | 随着年龄的增长，我们对自己最不愉快的发现之一是什么？
[00:20.55]At the age of twelve years, the human body is at its most vigorous. | 在十二岁时，人体处于最旺盛的状态。
[00:26.85]It has yet to reach its full size and strength, and its owner his or her full intelligence: but at this age the likelihood of death is least. | 它尚未达到完全的体型和力量，其主人也尚未达到完全的智力：但在此时，死亡的可能性最小。
[00:39.39]Earlier, we were infants and young children, and consequently more vulnerable; | 早些时候，我们是婴儿和幼儿，因此更容易受到伤害；
[00:47.25]later, we shall undergo a progressive loss of our vigour and resistance which, though imperceptible at first | 之后，我们将经历活力和抵抗力的逐渐丧失，这起初虽然难以察觉，
[00:56.61]will finally become so steep that we can live no longer, | 但最终会变得如此迅速，以至于我们无法再活下去，
[01:01.71]however well we look after ourselves, and however well society, and our doctors, look after us. | 无论我们如何精心照顾自己，也无论社会和医生如何精心照顾我们。
[01:10.10]This decline in vigour with the passing of time is called ageing. | 随着时间的推移，这种活力的衰退被称为衰老。
[01:15.34]It is one of the most unpleasant discoveries which we all make that we must decline in this way, that if we escape wars, | 我们都发现了一个最令人不快的现实，那就是我们必然会以这种方式衰老，如果我们能够幸免于战争、
[01:25.35]accidents and diseases we shall eventually 'die of old age', and that this happens at a rate which differs little from person to person, | 事故和疾病，最终我们将“老死”，而且这个过程的速度人与人之间差异很小，
[01:36.90]so that there are heavy odds in favour of our dying between the ages of 65 and 80. | 因此，我们很可能在65到80岁之间去世。
[01:44.68]Some of us will die sooner, a few will live longer -- on into a ninth or tenth decade. | 我们中有些人会更早去世，少数人会活得更久——进入第九或第十个十年。
[01:52.89]But the chances are against it, | 但这种机会渺茫，
[01:55.45]and there is a virtual limit on how long we can hope to remain alive, however lucky and robust we are. | 而且我们能期望活多久，无论我们多么幸运和健壮，都有一个实际的限制。
[02:03.88]Normal people tend to forget this process unless and until they are reminded of it. | 除非被提醒，否则常人往往会忘记这个过程。
[02:10.41]We are so familiar with the fact that man ages, that people have for years assumed that the process of losing vigour with time, | 我们对人会衰老这一事实非常熟悉，以至于人们多年来一直认为，随着时间流逝而失去活力，
[02:19.48]of becoming more likely to die the older we get, was something self-evident | 年纪越大越可能死亡的过程，是理所当然的事情，
[02:25.37]like the cooling of a hot kettle or the wearing-out of a pair of shoes. | 就像热水壶变凉或鞋子磨损一样。
[02:30.73]They have also assumed that all animals, | 他们还假设所有动物，
[02:34.17]and probably other organisms such as trees, or even the universe itself, must in the nature of things 'wear out'. | 以及其他生物，如树木，甚至宇宙本身，按照事物的本性都必然会“耗尽”。
[02:44.82]Most animals we commonly observe do in fact age as we do, | 我们通常观察到的大多数动物，如果活得足够长，
[02:49.82]if given the chance to live long enough; | 确实会像我们一样衰老；
[02:52.42]and mechanical systems like a wound watch, or the sun, | 而像上弦的钟表或太阳这样的机械系统，
[02:57.54]do in fact run out of energy in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics (whether the whole universe does so is a moot point at present). | 确实会根据热力学第二定律耗尽能量（整个宇宙是否如此，目前尚无定论）。
[03:09.17]But these are not analogous to what happens when man ages. | 但这些与人类衰老时发生的情况并不相似。
[03:14.68]A run-down watch is still a watch and can be rewound. | 一只停走的表仍然是一只表，可以重新上弦。
[03:19.89]An old watch, by contrast, becomes so worn and unreliable that it eventually is not worth mending. | 相比之下，一只旧表会变得磨损不堪，不可靠，最终不值得修理。
[03:29.98]But a watch could never repair itself--it does not consist of living parts, only of metal, which wears away by friction. | 但是表永远无法自我修复——它不包含活体部分，只有金属，金属会因摩擦而磨损。
[03:40.98]We could, at one time, repair ourselves--well enough, at least, to overcome all but the most instantly fatal illnesses and accidents. | 我们曾经能够自我修复——至少足以克服除了最即刻致命的疾病和事故之外的所有情况。
[03:53.69]Between twelve and eighty years we gradually lose this power; | 在十二岁到八十岁之间，我们逐渐失去这种能力；
[03:59.72]an illness which at 12 would knock us over, at 80 can knock us out, and into our grave. | 一种在12岁时会让我们病倒的疾病，在80岁时可能就会让我们倒下，并送入坟墓。
[04:08.79]If we could stay as vigorous as we are at twelve, | 如果我们能像十二岁时那样充满活力，
[04:12.54]it would take about 700 years for half of us to die, and another 700 for the survivors to be reduced by half again. | 大约需要700年我们中一半的人才会去世，再过700年，幸存者数量才会再次减少一半。
