[00:03.66]The cost of government | 政府的开支
[00:11.16]What's the most important factor, both in government or business, for keeping running costs low? | 无论在政府还是企业中，降低运营成本最重要的因素是什么？
[00:21.57]If a nation is essentialy disunited, it is left to the government to hold it together. | 如果一个国家本质上是分裂的，就只能由政府来维系它的统一。
[00:27.97]This increases the expense of government, and reduces correspondingly the amount of economic resources that could be used for developing the country. | 这增加了政府开支，并相应减少了可用于国家发展的经济资源。
[00:39.42]And it should not be forgotten how small those resources are in a poor and backward country. | 而且不应忘记，在一个贫穷落后的国家，这些资源是多么微薄。
[00:45.74]Where the cost of government is high, resources for development are correspondingly low. | 政府开支高的地方，发展资源也相应地少。
[00:52.66]This may be illustrated by comparing the position of a nation with that of a private business enterprise. | 这可以通过比较一个国家与一个私营企业的情况来说明。
[00:59.84]An enterprise has to incur certain costs and expenses in order to stay in business. | 一个企业为了维持经营，必须承担一定的成本和开支。
[01:06.88]For our purposes, we are concerned only with one kind of cost--the cost of managing and administering the business. | 就我们的目的而言，我们只关注一种成本——管理和经营企业的成本。
[01:15.36]Such administrative overheads in a business are analogous to the cost of government in a nation. | 企业中的此类行政管理费用类似于一个国家中的政府开支。
[01:22.53]The administrative overheads of a business are low to the extent that everyone working in the business | 企业的行政管理费用之所以低，是因为企业中的每个人
[01:28.21]can be trusted to behave in a way that best promotes the interests of the firm. | 都可以被信任，以最有利于公司利益的方式行事。
[01:34.06]If they can each be trusted to take such responsibilities, | 如果每个人都可以被信任来承担这些责任，
[01:37.79]and to exercise such initiative as falls within their sphere, then administrative overheads will be low. | 并在其职责范围内发挥主动性，那么行政管理费用就会很低。
[01:46.41]It will be low because it will be necessary to have only one man looking after each job without having another man to check upon what he is doing, | 之所以低，是因为只需要一个人负责一项工作，而不需要另一个人来检查他正在做什么，
[01:56.06]keep him in line, and report on him to someone else. | 约束他，并向其他人汇报他的情况。
[02:00.59]But if no one can be trusted to act in a loyal and responsible manner towards his job, | 但如果没人能被信任以忠诚负责的态度对待自己的工作，
[02:06.88]then the business will require armies of administrators, checkers and foremen and administrative overheads will rise correspondingly. | 那么企业将需要大量的管理人员、检查员和工头，行政管理费用也将相应地增加。
[02:16.66]As administrative overheads rise, so the earnings of the business after meeting the expense of administration, will fall; | 随着行政管理费用的增加，企业在支付行政开支后的收益将下降；
[02:24.76]and the business will have less money to distribute as dividends or invest directly in its future progress and development. | 企业将没有足够的资金来分配股息，或直接投资于其未来的发展。
[02:32.86]It is precisely the same with a nation. | 一个国家也是如此。
[02:36.06]To the extent that the people can be relied on to behave in a loyal and responsible manner, | 只要人民能够被信任以忠诚负责的方式行事，
[02:42.17]the government does not require armies of police and civil servants to keep them in order. | 政府就不需要大批警察和公务员来维持秩序。
[02:48.60]But if a nation is disunited, the government cannot be sure that the actions of the people will be in the interests of the nation; | 但如果一个国家是分裂的，政府就不能确定人民的行为是否符合国家利益；
[02:57.21]and it will have to watch, check, and control the people accordingly. | 它就必须相应地监视、检查和控制人民。
[03:02.36]A disunited nation therefore has to incur unduly high costs of government. | 因此，一个分裂的国家必然会产生过高的政府开支。
