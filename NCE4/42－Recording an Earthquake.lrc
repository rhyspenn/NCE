[00:02.45]Recording an earthquake | 记录地震
[00:09.95]What does a pen have to do to record on paper the vibrations generated by an earthquake? | 钢笔要怎样才能在纸上记录下地震产生的震动？
[00:18.95]An earthquake comes like a thief in the night, without warning. | 地震如同夜间的小偷，不打招呼就来了。
[00:23.69]It was necessary, therefore, to invent instruments that neither slumbered nor slept. | 因此，有必要发明出永不休眠的仪器。
[00:29.84]Some devices were quite simple. | 有些装置非常简单。
[00:32.36]One, for instance, consisted of rods of various lengths and thicknesses which would stand up on end like ninepins. | 例如，其中一种是由长短粗细不同的杆子组成，它们像九柱戏的木柱一样直立着。
[00:41.06]When a shock came, it shook the rigid table upon which these stood. | 当震动来临时，它就会摇晃这些杆子所立的坚硬桌子。
[00:46.36]If it were gentle, only the more unstable rods fell. | 如果震动轻微，只有那些更不稳定的杆子会倒下。
[00:51.17]If it were severe, they all fell. | 如果震动剧烈，它们会全部倒下。
[00:53.99]Thus the rods, by falling, and by the direction in which they fell, | 这样，杆子通过倒下，以及它们倒下的方向，
[00:58.85]recorded for the slumbering scientist the strength of a shock that was too weak to waken him, | 为熟睡的科学家记录了不足以将他惊醒的震动的强度，
[01:05.70]and the direction from which it came. | 以及它传来的方向。
[01:08.99]But instruments far more delicate than that were needed if any really serious advance was to be made. | 但如果想要取得任何真正重大的进展，就需要比这精巧得多的仪器。
[01:15.87]The ideal to be aimed at was to devise an instrument that could record with a pen on paper, | 理想目标是设计出一种能够用笔在纸上记录的仪器，
[01:22.77]the movements of the ground or of the table as the quake passed by. | 当地震发生时，记录地面或桌子的移动。
[01:28.24]While I write my pen moves, but the paper keeps still. | 我写字时笔动纸不动。
[01:32.57]With practice, no doubt, I could in time learn to write by holding the pen still while the paper moved. | 毫无疑问，经过练习，我最终能学会笔不动而纸动来写字。
[01:39.75]That sounds a silly suggestion, | 这听起来是个愚蠢的建议，
[01:42.31]but that was precisely the idea adopted in some of the early instruments (seismometers) for recording earthquake waves. | 但这正是早期一些用于记录地震波的仪器（地震仪）所采用的原理。
[01:51.70]But when table, penholder and paper are all moving, how is it possible to write legibly? | 但当桌子、笔架和纸都在移动时，如何才能清晰地书写呢？
[01:59.02]The key to a solution of that problem lay in an everyday observation. | 解决这个问题的关键在于一个日常观察。
[02:04.18]Why does a person standing in a bus or train tend to fall when a sudden start is made? | 为什么站在公共汽车或火车上的人，在突然启动时会倾向于摔倒？
[02:10.59]It is because his feet move on, but his head stays still. | 那是因为他的脚随之移动，但头部却保持静止。
[02:15.18]A simple experiment will help us a little further. | 一个简单的实验会帮助我们进一步理解。
[02:18.39]Tie a heavy weight at the end of a long piece of string. | 在一根长绳的末端系上一个重物。
[02:22.24]With the hand held high in the air, hold the string so that the weight nearly touches the ground. | 将手高举在空中，握住绳子，使重物几乎接触地面。
[02:28.78]Now move the hand to and fro and around but not up and down. | 现在，前后左右移动手，但不要上下移动。
[02:33.76]It will be found that the weight moves but slightly or not at all. | 你会发现重物只移动很小，甚至完全不动。
[02:38.34]Imagine a pen attached to the weight in such a way that its point rests upon a piece of paper on the floor. | 想象一支笔连接在重物上，笔尖落在地板上的一张纸上。
[02:44.93]Imagine an earthquake shock shaking the floor, the paper, you and your hand. | 想象一场地震震动着地板、纸、你和你的手。
[02:51.42]In the midst of all this movement, the weight and the pen would be still. | 在所有这些运动中，重物和笔会保持静止。
[02:55.97]But as the paper moved from side to side under the pen point, its movement would be recorded in ink upon its surface. | 但当纸在笔尖下左右移动时，它的运动就会以墨迹的形式记录在纸面上。
[03:04.18]It was upon this principle that the first instruments were made, but the paper was wrapped round a drum which rotated slowly. | 第一批仪器就是根据这个原理制造的，但纸是缠绕在一个缓慢旋转的鼓上的。
[03:13.20]As long as all was still, the pen drew a straight line, | 只要一切静止，笔就画出一条直线，
[03:17.64]but while the drum was being shaken, the line that the pen was drawing wriggled from side to side. | 但当鼓被摇晃时，笔所画的线就会左右扭动。
[03:25.18]The apparatus thus described, however, | 然而，这样描述的装置，
[03:27.85]records only the horizontal component of the wave movement, which is, in fact, much more complicated. | 只记录波浪运动的水平分量，而实际上，波浪运动要复杂得多。
[03:35.21]If we could actually see the path described by a particle, | 如果我们能真正看到一个粒子所描述的路径，
[03:39.21]such as a sand grain in the rock, | 例如岩石中的一个沙粒，
[03:41.95]it would be more like that of a bluebottle buzzing round the room; it would be up and down, to and fro and from side to side. | 它会更像一只苍蝇在房间里嗡嗡飞舞；它会上下、前后和左右移动。
[03:50.54]Instruments have been devised and can be so placed that all three elements can be recorded in different graphs. | 已经设计出仪器，并且可以这样放置，使得所有三个要素都能在不同的图表中记录下来。
[03:58.84]When the instrument is situated at more than 700 miles from the earthquake centre, | 当仪器位于距震中700多英里之外时，
[04:04.62]the graphic record shows three waves arriving one after the other at short intervals. | 图形记录显示三波在短时间内一个接一个地到达。
[04:10.63]The first records the arrival of longitudinal vibrations. | 第一波记录了纵向振动的到达。
[04:15.56]The second marks the arrival of transverse vibrations which travel more slowly and arrive several minutes after the first. | 第二波标志着横向振动的到达，它们传播速度较慢，比第一波晚几分钟到达。
[04:25.16]These two have travelled through the earth. | 这两波已经穿过地球。
[04:27.87]It was from the study of these that so much was learnt about the interior of the earth. | 正是通过对它们的研究，人们才对地球内部有了如此多的了解。
[04:33.66]The third, or main wave is the slowest and has travelled round the earth through the surface rocks. | 第三波，即主波，速度最慢，它通过地表岩石环绕地球传播。
