[00:36.13]They have a character, perhaps two; | 他们可能有一个人物，或许两个；
[00:39.10]they are in that condition of eager discomfort which passes for inspiration all admit radical changes of destination once the journey has begun; | 他们处于那种急切不安的状态，那种状态被认为是灵感，一旦旅程开始，所有人都承认目的地会发生根本性变化；
[00:50.66]one, to my certain knowledge, spent nine months on a novel about Kashmir, | 据我所知，有一位作家花九个月写了一部关于克什米尔的小说，
[00:57.61]then reset the whole thing in the Scottish Highlands. | 然后将整个故事背景改到了苏格兰高地。
[01:01.38]I never heard of anyone making a 'skeleton', as we were taught at school. | 我从未听说有人像我们在学校里学的那样，先写好“提纲”。

[01:14.80]the writer comes to discern things in his material which were not consciously in his mind when he began. | 作家开始辨明他材料中那些在开始时并未意识到的东西。
[01:22.83]This organic process, often leading to moments of extraordinary self-discovery, is of an indescribable fascination. | 这种有机过程，常常带来非凡的自我发现时刻，具有难以言喻的魅力。
[01:34.32]A blurred image appears; he adds a brushstroke and another and it is gone | 一个模糊的图像出现了；他添上一笔又一笔，然后它消失了，
[01:41.06]but something was there, and he will not rest till he has captured it. | 但有些东西曾在那儿，他不会停歇直到捕捉到它。
[01:46.68]Sometimes the yeast within a writer outlives a book he has written. | 有时，作家内心的“酵母”比他写的一本书活得更久。
[01:52.77]I have heard of writers who read nothing but their own books; | 我听说过有些作家除了自己的书什么都不读；
[01:57.01]like adolescents they stand before the mirror, | 他们像青少年一样站在镜子前，
[02:00.46]and still cannot fathom the exact outline of the vision before them. | 却仍然无法完全理解眼前景象的精确轮廓。

[02:12.37]winkling out hidden meanings, super-imposing new ones, | 挖掘隐藏的意义，叠加新的意义，
[02:17.19]begging response from those around them. | 乞求周围人的回应。
[02:20.57]Of course a writer doing this is misunderstood: he might as well try to explain a crime or a love affair. | 当然，这样做会使作家被误解：他倒不如去解释一起犯罪或一段恋情。

[02:34.63]This temptation to cover the distance between himself and the reader, | 这种弥合自己与读者之间距离的诱惑，
[02:39.63]to study his image in the sight of those who do not know him, can be his undoing: he has begun to write to please. | 在不认识他的人眼中审视自己的形象，可能会导致他的失败：他已经开始为了取悦他人而写作。
[02:51.65]A young English writer made the pertinent observation a year or two back | 一两年前，一位年轻的英国作家发表了中肯的评论，
[02:56.85]that the talent goes into the first draft, and the art into the drafts that follow. | 才能体现在初稿中，而艺术则体现在后续的草稿中。
[03:03.60]For this reason also the writer, like any other artist, | 也正是因为这个原因，作家，像其他任何艺术家一样，
[03:08.09]has no resting place, no crowd or movement in which he may take comfort, | 没有安身之所，没有可以从中寻求慰藉的人群或运动，

[03:20.66]A writer makes order out of the anarchy of his heart; | 作家从内心无序的状态中创造出秩序；
[03:24.70]he submits himself to a more ruthless discipline than any critic dreamed of, | 他让自己服从于一种比任何评论家所梦想的都更无情的纪律，
[03:30.73]and when he flirts with fame, he is taking time off from living with himself, | 当他追逐名利时，他是在从与自我共处中抽身，
