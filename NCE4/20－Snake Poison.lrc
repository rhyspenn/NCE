[00:02.24]Snake poison | 蛇毒
[00:08.79]What are the two different ways in which snake poison acts? | 蛇毒以哪两种不同方式发挥作用？
[00:15.32]How in came about that snakes manufactured poison is a mystery. | 蛇是怎样产生毒液的，这至今仍是个谜。
[00:20.33]Over the periods their saliva, a mild, digestive juice like our own, was converted into a poison that defies analysis even today. | 经过漫长的岁月，它们的唾液——一种像我们人类唾液一样的温和的消化液——变成了毒液，这种毒液即使在今天也无法分析其成分。
[00:30.46]It was not forced upon them by the survival competition; | 毒液并不是由生存竞争强加给它们的；
[00:34.46]they could have caught and lived on prey without using poison, just as the thousands of non-poisonous snakes still do. | 它们本来可以不用毒液捕食猎物而生存下来，就像成千上万的无毒蛇今天仍然在做的那样。
[00:42.76]Poison to a snake is merely a luxury; | 对蛇来说，毒液只是一种奢侈品；
[00:46.30]it enables it to get its food with very little effort, no more effort than one bite. | 它能使蛇毫不费力地获取食物，一口咬下去便大功告成。
[00:53.08]And why only snakes? | 为什么只有蛇有毒液呢？
[00:55.48]Cats, for instance, would be greatly helped; | 拿猫来说，毒液对它们会大有帮助；
[00:58.32]no running fights with large, fierce rats or tussles with grown rabbits--just a bite and no more effort needed. | 它们不必和凶猛的大老鼠追逐撕打，也不必和长大的兔子扭斗——只需一口咬下去，便不必再费力气了。
[01:06.56]In fact, it would be an assistance to all carnivores though it would be a two-edged weapon when they fought each other. | 事实上，毒液对所有的食肉动物都会有帮助，尽管在它们互相搏斗时，毒液会变成一把双刃剑。
[01:14.26]But, of the vertebrates unpredictable Nature selected only snakes (and one lizard). | 但在脊椎动物中，变幻莫测的大自然只选择了蛇（和一种蜥蜴）。
[01:20.85]One wonders also why Nature, with some snakes concocted poison of such extreme potency. | 人们也想知道，为什么大自然让有些蛇产生如此剧烈的毒液。
[01:28.19]In the conversion of saliva into poison, one might suppose that a fixed process took place. It did not; | 在唾液变为毒液的过程中，人们可能会认为发生了一个固定的过程。但事实并非如此；
[01:36.06]some snakes manufactured a poison different in every respect from that of others, | 有些蛇产生的毒液与另一些蛇的毒液在各个方面都不同，
[01:41.47]as different as arsenic is from strychnine, and having different effects. | 就像砷和士的宁的区别一样大，而且有不同的效果。
[01:47.07]One poison acts on the nerves, the other on the blood. | 一种毒液作用于神经，另一种作用于血液。
[01:51.50]The makers of the nerve poison include the mambas and the cobras and their venom is called neurotoxic. | 产生神经毒液的包括曼巴蛇和眼镜蛇，它们的毒液被称为神经毒素。
[01:59.29]Vipers (adders) and rattlesnakes manufacture the blood poison, which is known as haemolytic. | 蝰蛇（蝮蛇）和响尾蛇产生血液毒液，这种毒液被称为溶血性毒素。
[02:07.07]Both poisons are unpleasant, but by far the more unpleasant is the blood poison. | 两种毒液都不好，但更不好的是血液毒液。
[02:12.61]It is said that the nerve poison is the more primitive of the two, that the blood poison is, so to speak, a newer product from an improved formula. | 据说神经毒液是两种毒液中较原始的一种，而血液毒液，可以说，是改进配方的新产品。
[02:22.08]Be that as it may, the nerve poison does its business with man far more quickly than the blood poison. | 话虽如此，神经毒液对人起作用的速度比血液毒液快得多。
[02:28.44]This, however, means nothing. | 然而，这并不说明什么。
[02:30.85]Snakes did not acquire their poison for use against man but for use against prey such as rats and mice, | 蛇获得毒液并不是为了对付人，而是为了对付像老鼠之类的小动物，
[02:38.20]and the effects on these of viperine poison is almost immediate. | 蝰蛇毒液对这些猎物几乎能立即见效。
