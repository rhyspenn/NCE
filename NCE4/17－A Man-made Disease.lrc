[00:02.78]A man-made disease | 人为的疾病
[00:11.76]What factor helped to spread the disease of myxomatosis? | 是什么因素帮助传播了黏液瘤病？
[00:18.28]In the early days of the settlement of Australia, enterprising settlers unwisely introduced the European rabbit. | 在澳大利亚早期定居时，富有进取心的定居者不明智地引进了欧洲兔。
[00:28.42]This rabbit had no natural enemies in the Antipodes, so that it multiplied with that promiscuous abandon characteristic of rabbits. | 这种兔子在大洋洲没有天敌，因此它以兔子特有的滥交放纵方式大量繁殖。
[00:40.42]It overran a whole continent. | 它遍布了整个大陆。
[00:43.87]It caused devastation by burrowing and by devouring the herbage which might have maintained millions of sheep and cattle. | 它通过挖洞和吞食草料造成了破坏，这些草料本可以养活数百万只绵羊和牛。
[00:52.99]Scientists discovered that this particular variety of rabbit (and apparently no other animal) was susceptible to a fatal virus disease, myxomatosis. | 科学家发现，这种特殊品种的兔子（显然没有其他动物）易感染一种致命的病毒性疾病——黏液瘤病。
[01:06.84]By infecting animals and letting them loose in the burrows, local epidemics of this disease could be created. | 通过感染动物并将它们释放到洞穴中，可以制造这种疾病的局部流行。
[01:15.06]Later it was found that there was a type of mosquito which acted as the carrier of this disease and passed it on to the rabbits. | 后来发现有一种蚊子充当这种疾病的载体，并将其传播给兔子。
[01:23.84]So while the rest of the world was trying to get rid of mosquitoes, Australia was encouraging this one. | 因此，当世界其他地方都在努力消灭蚊子时，澳大利亚却在鼓励这种蚊子。
[01:31.14]It effectively spread the disease all over the continent and drastically reduced the rabit population. | 它有效地将疾病传播到整个大陆，并大幅减少了兔子数量。
[01:39.62]It later became apparent that rabbits were developing a degree of resistance to this disease, | 后来，很明显兔子对这种疾病正在产生一定程度的抵抗力，
[01:45.88]so that the rabbit population was unlikely to be completely exterminated. | 因此兔子种群不太可能被完全消灭。
[01:51.88]There were hopes, however, that the problem of the rabbit would become manageable. | 然而，人们希望兔子的（鼠害）问题能够变得可控。
[01:58.72]Ironically, Europe, which had bequeathed the rabbit as a pest to Australia, acquired this man-made disease as a pestilence. | 具有讽刺意味的是，欧洲将兔子作为害虫遗赠给澳大利亚，现在却将这种人为的疾病视为一场瘟疫。
[02:09.37]A French physician decided to get rid of the wild rabbits on his own estate and introduced myxomatosis. | 一位法国医生决定清除自己庄园里的野兔，并引入了黏液瘤病。
[02:17.03]It did not, however, remain within the confines of this estate. | 然而，它并没有局限于这个庄园。
[02:22.13]It spread through France, where wild rabbits are not generally regarded as a pest but as a sport and a useful food supply, | 它传播到法国，在那里野兔通常不被视为害虫，而是作为一项运动和有用的食物来源，
[02:31.53]and it spread to Britain where wild rabbits are regarded as a pest but where domesticated rabbits, | 并传播到英国，在那里野兔被视为害虫，但家养兔子，
[02:38.62]equally susceptible to the disease, are the basis of a profitable fur industry. | 同样易受这种疾病感染，却是利润丰厚的毛皮产业的基础。
[02:45.50]The question became one of whether Man could control the disease he had invented. | 问题变成了人类是否能够控制他所制造的疾病。
