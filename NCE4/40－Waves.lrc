[00:02.24]Waves | 波浪
[00:09.08]What false impression does an ocean wave convey to the observer? | 海洋波浪给观察者带来了什么错误的印象？
[00:15.37]Waves are the children of the struggle between ocean and atmosphere, the ongoing signatures of infinity. | 波浪是海洋与大气搏斗的产物，是永恒的无限的印记。
[00:23.26]Rays from the sun excite and energize the atmosphere of the earth, awakening it to flow, to movement, to rhythm, to life. | 太阳的光线激发并激活了地球的大气层，使其流动、运动、有节奏、有生命。
[00:33.29]The wind then speaks the message of the sun to the sea | 风将太阳的信息传递给大海
[00:37.20]and the sea transmits it on through waves--an ancient, exquisite powerful message. | 大海通过波浪将其传递出去——一个古老、精致、有力的信息。
[00:45.48]These ocean waves are among the earth's most complicated natural phenomena. | 这些海浪是地球上最复杂的自然现象之一。
[00:51.45]The basic features include a crest (the highest point of the wave), | 基本特征包括波峰（波浪的最高点），
[00:56.13]a trough (the lowest point), a height (the vertical distance from the trough to the crest), | 波谷（最低点），波高（从波谷到波峰的垂直距离），
[01:03.67]a wave length (the horizontal distance between two wave crests), | 波长（两个波峰之间的水平距离），
[01:08.99]and a period (which is the time it takes awave crest to travel one wave length). | 和周期（波峰传播一个波长所需的时间）。
[01:16.21]Although an ocean wave gives the impression of a wall of water moving in your direction, | 尽管海浪给人一种水墙向你移动的印象，
[01:22.46]in actuality waves move through the water leaving the water about where it was. | 但实际上，波浪穿过水体，使水大致停留在原来的位置。
[01:29.36]If the water was moving with the wave, | 如果水体随波浪移动，
[01:32.06]the ocean and everything on it would be racing in to the shore with obviously catastrophic results. | 海洋和其上的一切都会冲向海岸，显然会造成灾难性的后果。
[01:40.03]An ocean wave passing through deep water causes a particle on the surface to move in a roughly circular orbit, | 海浪穿过深水时，会使水面上的粒子呈近似圆形轨道运动，
[01:48.49]drawing the particle first towards the advancing wave, then up into the wave, | 首先将粒子拉向前进的波浪，然后向上进入波浪，
[01:54.41]then forward with it and then--as the wave leaves the particles behind--back to its starting point again. | 然后随波浪向前，接着——当波浪将粒子留在身后时——回到其起始点。
[02:03.30]From both maturity to death, a wave is subject to the same laws as any other 'living' thing. | 从形成到消亡，波浪与任何其他“有生命”的事物一样，都遵循相同的规律。
[02:10.15]For a time it assumes a miraculous individuality that, in the end, is reabsorbed into the great ocean of life. | 在一段时间内，它呈现出奇妙的个体性，最终又重新融入生命的浩瀚海洋。
[02:19.11]The undulating waves of the open sea are generated by three natural causes: | 开阔海域的波浪由三种自然原因产生：
[02:25.25]wind, earth movements or tremors, and the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. | 风、地壳运动或震动，以及月亮和太阳的引力。
[02:31.95]Once waves have been generated, | 一旦波浪产生，
[02:34.14]gravity is the force that drives them in a continual attempt to restore the ocean surface to a flat plain. | 引力便是驱使它们不断尝试将海洋表面恢复到平坦状态的力量。
