[00:02.38]Exploring the sea-floor | 探索海底
[00:09.48]How did people probably imagine the sea-floor before it was investigated? | 在海底被勘测之前，人们可能如何想象它？
[00:17.45]Our knowledge of the oceans a hundred years ago was confined to the two-dimensional shape of the sea surface | 一百年前，我们对海洋的了解仅限于海面的二维形状
[00:24.90]and the hazards of navigation presented by the irregularities in depth of the shallow water close to the land. | 以及陆地附近浅水区深度不规则所带来的航行危险。
[00:33.53]The open sea was deep and mysterious, | 开阔的海洋深邃而神秘，
[00:36.86]and anyone who gave more than a passing thought to the bottom confines of the oceans probably assumed that the sea-bed was flat. | 任何对海洋底部边界稍加思考的人可能都认为海床是平坦的。
[00:45.67]Sir James Clark Ross had obtained a sounding of over 2, 400 fathoms in 1839, | 詹姆斯·克拉克·罗斯爵士于1839年测得超过2400噚的深度，
[00:53.26]but it was not until 1869, when H.M.S. Porcupine was put at the disposal of the Royal Society for several cruises | 但直到1869年，当“豪猪号”军舰被皇家学会征用进行数次航行时，
[01:03.38]that a series of deep soundings was obtained in the Atlantic and the first samples were collected by dredging the bottom. | 才在大西洋获得了一系列深海探测数据，并通过海底拖网收集了第一批样本。
[01:11.84]Shortly after this the famous H.M.S. Challenger expedition established the study of the sea-floor | 此后不久，著名的“挑战者号”军舰远征队确立了海底研究
[01:19.01]as a subject worthy of the most qualified physicists and geologists. | 成为值得最合格的物理学家和地质学家研究的课题。
[01:24.37]A burst of activity associated with the laying of submarine cables | 随之而来的海底电缆铺设热潮
[01:29.62]soon confirmed the Challenger's observation that many parts of the ocean were two to three miles deep, | 很快证实了“挑战者号”的观测结果：海洋许多地方深达两到三英里，
[01:37.28]and the existence of underwater features of considerable magnitude. | 并存在着规模巨大的水下特征。
[01:42.74]Today, enough soundings are available to enable a relief map of the Atlantic to be drawn | 如今，已有的测深数据足以绘制出大西洋的浮雕地图，
[01:49.02]and we know something of the great variety of the sea bed's topography. | 我们对海底地形的巨大多样性有了一定的了解。
[01:54.78]Since the sea covers the greater part of the earth's surface, | 由于海洋覆盖了地球表面的大部分，
[01:58.56]it is quite reasonable to regard the sea floor as the basic form of the crust of the earth, | 将海底视为地壳的基本形态是相当合理的，
[02:04.88]with superimposed upon it the continents, | 大陆、
[02:08.74]together with the islands and other features of the oceans. | 以及岛屿和海洋的其他特征都叠加其上。
[02:13.05]The continents form rugged tablelands which stand nearly three miles above the floor of the open ocean. | 大陆形成了崎岖不平的高原，它们比开阔海洋的海底高出近三英里。
[02:20.95]From the shore line, out to a distance which may be anywhere from a few miles to a few hundred miles, | 从海岸线向外延伸，距离可能从几英里到几百英里不等，
[02:28.63]runs the gentle slope of the continental shelf, geologically part of the continents. | 是大陆架的平缓斜坡，它在地质学上属于大陆的一部分。
[02:35.45]The real dividing line between continents and oceans occurs at the foot of a steeper slope. | 大陆和海洋的真正分界线出现在一个更陡峭的斜坡底部。
[02:42.70]This continental slope usually starts at a place somewhere near the 100-fathom mark | 这个大陆坡通常始于100噚标记附近的某个地方，
[02:48.91]and in the course of a few hundred miles reaches the true ocean floor at 2, 500-3, 500 fathoms. | 并在几百英里的延伸中到达2500-3500噚的真正海底。
[02:59.08]The slope averages about 1 in 30, but contains steep, | 该斜坡平均坡度约为1:30，但包含陡峭的、
[03:03.49]probably vertical, cliffs, and gentle sediment-covered terraces, | 可能是垂直的悬崖，以及平缓的被沉积物覆盖的阶地，
[03:08.14]and near its lower reaches there is a long tailing-off which is almost certainly the result of | 在其下部区域，有一个长长的逐渐减缓的坡段，这几乎肯定是由于
[03:14.36]material transported out to deep water after being eroded from the continental masses. | 物质从大陆块体被侵蚀后输送到深水区的结果。
