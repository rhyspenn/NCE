[00:02.42]The search for oil | 寻找石油
[00:10.79]What do oilmen want to achieve as soon as they strike oil? | 石油工人一旦发现石油，他们最想达到什么目标？
[00:16.98]The deepest holes of all are made for oil, and they go down to as much as 25, 000 feet. | 所有最深的孔都是为石油而钻的，它们深达25,000英尺。
[00:26.09]But we do not need to send man down to get the oil out, as we must with other mineral deposits. | 但我们不需要像开采其他矿藏那样派人下去取油。
[00:34.31]The holes are only borings, less than a foot in diameter. | 这些孔只是钻孔，直径不到一英尺。
[00:40.18]My particular experience is largely in oil, and the search for oil has done more to improve deep drilling than any other mining activity. | 我尤其在石油方面经验丰富，而寻找石油对深层钻探的改进作用，比任何其他采矿活动都要大。
[00:52.31]When it has been decided where we are going to drill, | 当我们决定了钻探地点之后，
[00:56.08]we put up at the surface an oil derrick. | 我们就会在地面上架设一个采油井架。
[00:59.84]It has to be tall because it is like a giant block and tackle and we have to lower into the ground | 它必须很高，因为它就像一个巨大的滑轮组，我们必须把巨大的钻杆放下去，
[01:06.82]and haul out of the ground great lengths of drill pipe which are rotated by an engine at the top | 并把巨大的钻杆从地下拉上来，这些钻杆由顶部的发动机带动旋转，
[01:13.84]and are fitted with a cutting bit at the bottom. | 底部装有钻头。
[01:17.95]The geologist needs to know what rocks the drill has reached, | 地质学家需要知道钻头钻到了什么岩石，
[01:22.67]so every so often a sample is obtained with a coring bit. | 因此，每隔一段时间就会用取心钻头取一个样本。
[01:28.11]It cuts a clean cylinder of rock, from which can be seen the strata the drill has been cutting through. | 它能切下一段干净的圆柱形岩石，从中可以看到钻头穿过的地层。
[01:36.45]Once we get down to the oil, it usually flows to the surface because great pressure either from gas or water, is pushing it. | 一旦我们钻到石油，它通常会流到地表，因为巨大的压力，无论是来自天然气还是水，都在推动它。
[01:46.93]This pressure must be under control, and we control it by means of the mud which we circulate down the drill pipe. | 这种压力必须得到控制，我们通过循环注入钻杆的泥浆来控制它。
[01:56.22]We endeavour to avoid the old, romantic idea of a gusher, which wastes oil and gas. | 我们努力避免那种老式的、浪漫的喷油井，那只会浪费石油和天然气。
[02:04.33]We want it to stay down the hole until we can lead it off in a controlled manner. | 我们希望它留在井下，直到我们能以受控的方式将其引出。
