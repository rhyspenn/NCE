[01:44.69]The Americans would happily reach one accord on standards for medical devices and then hammer out different pacts covering, say, electronic goods and drug manufacturing. | 美国人乐意先就医疗器械标准达成一项协议，然后再敲定涵盖电子产品和药品生产等不同协议。

[02:02.77]which could be applied to many types of products and perhaps extended to other countries. | 这些原则可以适用于多种类型的产品，并且可能扩展到其他国家。
