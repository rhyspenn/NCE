[02:28.94]These days, it is differences in national regulations, far more than tariffs, that put sand in the wheels of trade between rich countries. | 如今，是各国法规的差异，而不是关税，阻碍了富裕国家之间的贸易。
[00:39.33]It is not just farmers who are complaining. | 抱怨的不仅仅是农民。
[00:42.33]An electric razor that meets the European Union's safety standards must be approved by American testers before it can be sold in the United States, and an American-made dialysis machine needs the EU's okay before it hits the market in Europe. | 一款符合欧盟安全标准的电动剃须刀，在美国销售前必须通过美国测试员的批准；一台美国制造的透析机，在欧洲上市前需要得到欧盟的许可。

[01:07.60]So, ask businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, why have two lots of tests where one would do? | 因此，大西洋两岸的企业都在问，为什么需要进行两套测试，而一套就足够了？

[01:40.07]Why? One difficulty is to construct the agreements. | 为什么？一个困难是构建协议。
[01:44.69]The Americans would happily reach one accord on standards for medical devices and then hammer out different pacts covering, say, electronic goods and drug manufacturing. | 美国人乐意先就医疗器械标准达成一项协议，然后再敲定涵盖电子产品和药品生产等不同协议。
[01:56.39]The EU -- following fine continental traditions -- wants agreement on general principles, | 欧盟——遵循优良的欧洲大陆传统——希望就普遍原则达成协议，
[02:02.77]which could be applied to many types of products and perhaps extended to other countries. | 这些原则可以适用于多种类型的产品，并且可能扩展到其他国家。
