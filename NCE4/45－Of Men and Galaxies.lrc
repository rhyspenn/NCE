[00:11.20]What is the most influential factor in any human society? | 在任何人类社会中，最具影响力的因素是什么？
[00:18.75]In man's early days, competition with other creatures must have been critical. | 在人类早期，与其他生物的竞争一定是至关重要的。
[00:25.22]But this phase of our development is now finished. | 但我们发展的这个阶段现在已经结束了。
[00:28.88]Indeed, we lack practice and experience nowadays in dealing with primitive conditions. | 事实上，我们现在缺乏处理原始条件的实践和经验。
[00:35.97]I am sure that, without modern weapons, | 我确信，如果没有现代武器，
[00:39.21]I would make a very poor show of disputing the ownership of a cave with a bear, and in this I do not think that I stand alone. | 我在与熊争夺洞穴所有权方面会表现得很糟糕，而且我认为我并非孤身一人。
[00:49.65]The last creature to compete with man was the mosquito. | 最后一种与人类竞争的生物是蚊子。
[00:53.96]But even the mosquito has been subdued by attention to drainage and by chemical sprays. | 但即使是蚊子也因对排水的重视和化学喷雾而被制服了。
[01:01.53]Competition between ourselves, person against person, | 我们彼此之间的竞争，人与人之间，
[01:06.13]community against community, still persists, however; and it is as fierce as it ever was. | 社群与社群之间，仍然存在；而且它和以往一样激烈。
[01:14.55]But the competition of man against man is not the simple process envisioned in biology. | 但人与人之间的竞争并不是生物学中设想的简单过程。
[01:21.74]It is not a simple competition for a fixed amount of food determined by the physical environment, | 这不是一种由物理环境决定的对固定数量食物的简单竞争，
[01:28.55]because the environment that determines our evolution is no longer essentially physical. | 因为决定我们进化的环境本质上不再是物理的了。
[01:35.73]Our environment is chiefly conditoned by the things we believe. | 我们的环境主要由我们所相信的事物所决定。
[01:41.69]Morocco and California are bits of the Earth in very similar latitudes, | 摩洛哥和加利福尼亚是地球上纬度非常相似的两个地方，
[01:47.47]both on the west coasts of continents with similar climates, and probably with rather similar natural resources. | 都位于大陆西海岸，气候相似，而且可能拥有相当相似的自然资源。
[01:55.79]Yet their present development is wholly different, | 然而，它们目前的发展却截然不同，
[02:00.02]not so much because of different people even, | 甚至不是因为不同的人，
[02:03.48]but because of the different thoughts that exist in the minds of their inhabitants. | 而是因为其居民心中存在的不同思想。
[02:09.45]This is the point I wish to emphasize. | 这就是我希望强调的重点。
[02:12.44]The most important factor in our environment is the state of our own minds. | 我们环境中最重要的因素是我们自己的心智状态。
[02:19.02]It is well known that where the white man has invaded a primitive culture, | 众所周知，当白人侵入原始文化时，
[02:24.02]the most destructive effects have come not from physical weapons but from ideas. | 最具破坏性的影响并非来自实体武器，而是来自思想。
[02:31.35]Ideas are dangerous. | 思想是危险的。
[02:34.29]The Holy Office knew this full well when it caused heretics to be burned in days gone by. | 过去的异端裁判所对此心知肚明，因为它曾将异教徒烧死。
[02:41.11]Indeed, the concept of free speech only exists in our modern society because when you are inside a community, | 事实上，言论自由的概念之所以存在于我们的现代社会，是因为当你身处一个社群中时，
[02:50.23]you are conditioned by the conventions of the community to such a degree that it is very difficult to conceive of anything really destructive. | 你被社群的习俗所制约，以至于很难构想出任何真正具有破坏性的事物。
[03:00.76]It is only someone looking on from outside that can inject the dangerous thoughts. | 只有旁观者才能注入危险的思想。
[03:07.35]I do not doubt that it would be possible to inject ideas into the modern world that would utterly destroy us. | 我不怀疑有可能向现代世界注入彻底摧毁我们的思想。
[03:15.04]I would like to give you an example, but fortunately I cannot do so. | 我想给你们举个例子，但幸运的是我不能。
[03:21.17]Perhaps it will suffice to mention the nuclear bomb. | 也许提到核弹就足够了。
[03:25.22]Imagine the effect on a reasonably advanced technological society, | 想象一下，对一个相当先进的科技社会，
[03:31.00]one that still does not possess the bomb, of making it aware of the possibility, of supplying suffcient details to enable the thing to be constructed. | 一个尚未拥有核弹的社会，如果让它意识到可能性，并提供足够的细节使其能够被建造出来，那会产生什么影响。
[03:42.11]20 or 30 pages of information handed to any of the major world powers around the year 1925, | 1925年左右，将20或30页信息交给任何一个世界主要大国，
[03:50.06]would have been sufficient to change the course of world history. | 足以改变世界历史的进程。
[03:54.74]It is a strange thought, but I believe a correct one, | 这是一个奇怪的想法，但我相信它是正确的，
[03:59.40]that twenty or thirty pages of ideas and information would be capable of turning the present-day world upside down, or even destroying it. | 即二三十页的思想和信息就足以颠覆当今世界，甚至摧毁它。
[04:12.66]I have often tried to conceive of what those pages might contain, | 我曾多次试图构想那些页面可能包含什么，
