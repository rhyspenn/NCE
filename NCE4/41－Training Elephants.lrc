[00:02.75]Training elephants | 训练大象
[00:10.54]At what point does the training of a captive wild elephant begin? | 一头被俘获的野象，它的训练从什么时候开始呢？
[00:17.74]Two main techniques have been used for training elephants, which we may call respectively the tough and the gentle. | 训练大象主要有两种方法，我们可以分别称之为“严酷法”和“温和法”。
[00:27.25]The former method simply consists of setting an elephant to work and beating him until he does what is expected of him. | 前一种方法就是让一头大象去干活，然后鞭打它，直到它按要求去做。
[00:36.67]Apart from any moral considerations this is a stupid method of training, | 撇开所有道德因素不谈，这是一种愚蠢的训练方法，
[00:42.29]for it produces a resentful animal who at a later stage may well turn man-killer. | 因为它会使动物心怀怨恨，而且在以后很可能会成为“杀人犯”。
[00:49.31]The gentle method requires more patience in the early stages, | 温和法在早期阶段需要更多的耐心，
[00:53.72]but produce a cheerful good-tempered elephant who will give many years of loyal service. | 但它会培养出性情愉快、脾气温顺的大象，这种大象会提供多年的忠诚服务。
[01:01.86]The first essential in elephant training is to assign to the animal a single mahout who will be entirely responsible for the job. | 训练大象的首要任务是给它指派一位驯象师，由他全权负责这项工作。
[01:12.02]Elephants like to have one master just as dogs do, and are capable of a considerable degree of personal affection. | 大象像狗一样喜欢只有一个主人，并且能够产生相当程度的个人感情。
[01:21.71]There are even stories of half-trained elephant calves who have refused to feed and pined to death | 甚至有这样的故事：一些半驯化的小象，它们拒绝进食并悲伤而死，
[01:30.54]when by some unavoidable circumstance they have been deprived of their own trainer. | 当它们因某些不可避免的情况失去了自己的驯象师时。
[01:38.41]Such extreme cases must probably be taken with a grain of salt, | 这种极端的例子也许不能完全相信，
[01:43.26]but they do underline the general principle that the relationship between elephant and mahout is the key to successful training. | 但它们确实强调了一个普遍原则：驯象师与大象之间的关系是训练成功的关键。
[01:54.24]The most economical age to capture an elephant for training is between 15 and 20 years, | 捕获大象进行训练最经济的年龄是15到20岁之间，
[02:01.53]for it is then almost ready to undertake heavy work and can begin to earn its keep straight away. | 因为这个年龄段的大象几乎已经准备好承担重活，可以立即开始赚钱养活自己。
[02:09.29]But animals of this age do not easily become subservient to man, and a very firm hand must be employed in the early stages. | 但这个年龄的动物不容易顺从人类，所以在早期阶段必须采用非常强硬的手段。
[02:19.42]The captive elephant, still roped to a tree, | 被俘获的大象，仍然被绳子系在一棵树上，
[02:22.74]plunges and screams every time a man approaches, and for several days will probably refuse all food through anger and fear. | 每当有人靠近，它就会猛冲并尖叫，而且好几天可能会因愤怒和恐惧而拒绝所有食物。
[02:34.27]Sometimes a tame elephant is tethered nearby to give the wild one confidence, | 有时，一头驯服的大象会被拴在附近，以给野象信心，
[02:40.27]and in most cases the captive gradually quietens down and begins to accept its food. | 在大多数情况下，被俘获的大象会逐渐平静下来，并开始接受食物。
[02:47.81]The next stage is to get the elephant to the training establishment, | 下一个阶段是将大象带到训练机构，
[02:51.87]a ticklish business which is achieved with the aid of two tame elephants roped to the captive on either side. | 这是一项棘手的工作，需要两头驯服的大象分别系在被俘获的大象两侧来完成。
[02:59.97]When several elephants are being trained at one time, | 当几头大象同时被训练时，
[03:04.05]it is customary for the new arrival to be placed between the stalls of two captives whose training is already well advanced. | 习惯上会将新来的大象放置在两头已经训练有素的被俘大象的兽栏之间。
[03:13.88]It is then left completely undisturbed with plenty of food and water | 然后它被完全地置于安静的环境中，提供充足的食物和水，
[03:19.15]so that it can absorb the atmosphere of its new home and see that nothing particularly alarming is happening to its companions. | 这样它就能适应新家的环境，并看到它的同伴们没有发生什么特别令人担忧的事情。
[03:28.39]When it is eating normally, its own training begins. | 当它正常进食时，它自己的训练就开始了。
[03:33.27]The trainer stands in front of the elephant holding a long stick with a sharp metal point. | 驯象师站在大象前面，手持一根带有锋利金属尖头的长棍。
[03:39.70]Two assistants, mounted on tame elephants, control the captive from either side, | 两名助手骑在驯服的大象上，从两侧控制被俘获的大象，
[03:46.63]while others rub their hands over his skin to the accompaniment of a monotonous and soothing chant. | 同时其他人则在大象的皮肤上摩擦双手，并伴随着单调而舒缓的歌谣。
[03:55.06]This is supposed to induce pleasurable sensations in the elephant, | 这应该在大象身上引起愉悦的感觉，
[03:59.73]and its effects are reinforced by the use of endearing epithets, | 它的效果通过使用亲切的称呼得到加强，
[04:03.69]such as 'ho! my son', or 'ho! my father', or 'my mother', according to the age and sex of the captive. | 比如“嘿！我的孩子”，“嘿！我的父亲”，或者“我的母亲”，这取决于被俘大象的年龄和性别。
[04:15.71]The elephant is not immediately susceptible to such blandishments, however, and usually lashes fiercely with its trunk in all directions. | 然而，大象不会立即屈服于这种哄骗，通常会用象鼻猛烈地向四面八方挥舞。
[04:25.47]These movements are controlled by the trainer with the metal-pointed stick, | 这些动作由驯象师用金属尖头棍控制，
[04:30.01]and the trunk eventually becomes so sore that the elephant curls it up and seldom afterwards uses it for offensive purposes. | 象鼻最终会变得非常疼痛，以至于大象会把它卷起来，并且之后很少用于攻击目的。
