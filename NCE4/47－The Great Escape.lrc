[00:02.83]The great escape | 绝妙的逃离
[00:10.41]What is one of the features of modern camping where nationality is concerned? | 论及国籍时，现代露营的特点之一是什么？
[00:18.10]Economy is one powerful motive for camping, | 经济是露营的一个强大动力，
[00:22.33]since after the initial outlay upon equipment, or through hiring it, the total expense can be far less than the cost of hotels. | 因为在设备初期投入或租用之后，总费用会远低于住酒店的开销。
[00:34.23]But, contrary to a popular assumption, it is far from being the only one, or even the greatest. | 但是，与一种普遍的看法相反，这绝非唯一的，甚至也不是最大的动力。
[00:44.23]The man who manoeuvres carelessly into his 20 pounds' worth of space at one of Europe's myriad permanent sites may find himself bumping a Bentley. | 那个漫不经心地把车开进欧洲无数固定营地之一、仅值20英镑空间的露营者，可能会发现自己的车碰到了宾利。
[00:55.54]More likely, Ford Escort will be hub to hub with Renault or Mercedes, but rarely with bicycles made for two. | 更可能的情况是，福特Escort会和雷诺或梅赛德斯并排停放，但很少会和双人自行车并排。
[01:06.19]That the equipment of modern camping becomes yearly more sophisticated is an entertaining paradox for the cynic, | 现代露营设备每年都变得更加精密，这对愤世嫉俗者来说是一个有趣的悖论，
[01:15.25]a brighter promise for the hopeful traveller who has sworn to get away from it all. | 对发誓要摆脱一切的满怀希望的旅行者来说则是一个更美好的前景。
[01:21.14]It also provides--and some student sociologist might care to base his thesis upon the phenomenon--an escape of another kind. | 它还提供了——某个社会学学生或许会以此现象为基础撰写论文——另一种形式的逃离。
[01:33.12]The modern traveller is often a man who dislikes the Splendide and the Bellavista, | 现代旅行者往往不喜欢“Splendide”和“Bellavista”这样的酒店，
[01:39.19]not because he cannot afford, or shuns their material comforts, but because he is afraid of them. | 不是因为他负担不起或避开它们的物质享受，而是因为他害怕它们。
[01:47.22]Affluent he may be, but he is by no means sure what to tip the doorman or the chambermaid. | 他可能很富裕，但绝不确定该给门童或女服务员多少小费。
[01:55.49]Master in his own house he has little idea of when to say boo to a manager hotel. | 他在自己家里是个主人，却不知道何时该对酒店经理发号施令。
[02:04.49]From all such fears camping releases him. | 露营将他从所有这些恐惧中解脱出来。
[02:08.23]Granted, a snobbery of camping itself, based upon equipment and techniques, already exists; | 诚然，露营本身就存在一种基于装备和技术的势利眼；
[02:16.19]but it is of a kind that, if he meets it, he can readily understand and deal with. | 但如果他遇到这种势利，他也能很容易理解和应对。
[02:22.93]There is no superior 'they' in the shape of managements and hotel hierarchies to darken his holiday days. | 没有以管理层和酒店等级制度形式出现的上级“他们”来给他假期蒙上阴影。
[02:32.21]To such motives, yet another must be added. | 除了这些动机，还必须加上另一个。
[02:36.45]The contemporary phenomenon of car worship is to be explained not least by the sense of independence and freedom that ownership entails. | 当代汽车崇拜现象，其原因很大程度上在于拥有汽车所带来的独立和自由感。
[02:47.35]To this pleasure camping gives an exquisite refinement. | 露营为这种乐趣增添了一种精致的升华。
[02:52.24]From one's own front door to home or foreign hills or sands and back again, everything is to hand. | 从自家门前到国内或国外的山丘沙滩再返回，一切尽在掌握。
[03:01.50]Not only are the means of arriving at the holiday paradise entirely within one's own command and keeping, | 不仅抵达度假天堂的交通工具完全由自己掌控和保管，
[03:09.13]but the means of escape from holiday hell (if the beach proves too crowded, the local weather too inclement) | 而且从度假地狱中逃脱的手段（如果海滩过于拥挤，当地天气过于恶劣）
[03:17.68]are there, outside--or, as likely, part of--the tent. | 就在帐篷外面——或者，更有可能的是，就在帐篷里。
[03:25.20]Idealists have objected to the practice of camping, as to the package tour, | 理想主义者反对露营，就像反对跟团游一样，
[03:31.06]that the traveller abroad thereby denies himself the opportunity of getting to know the people of the country visited. | 认为出国旅行者因此剥夺了自己了解所访国家人民的机会。
[03:38.46]Insularity and self-containment, it is argued, go hand in hand. | 有人认为，与世隔绝和自我封闭是并存的。
[03:44.87]The opinion does not survive experience of a popular Continental camping place. | 但这种观点在体验过一个受欢迎的欧洲大陆露营地后便不攻自破。
[03:50.49]Holiday hotels tend to cater for one nationality of visitors especially, sometimes exclusively. | 度假酒店往往特别迎合——有时甚至专门迎合——某一国籍的游客。
[03:59.77]Camping sites, by contrast, are highly cosmopolitan. | 相比之下，露营地则高度国际化。
[04:04.55]Granted, a preponderance of Germans is a characteristic that seems common to most Mediterranean sites; | 诚然，德国人占多数似乎是大多数地中海营地的共同特点；
[04:12.51]but as yet there is no overwhelmingly specialized patronage. | 但到目前为止，还没有出现压倒性的专业赞助。
[04:18.28]Notices forbidding the open-air drying of clothes, | 禁止户外晾晒衣物、
[04:21.77]or the use of water points for car washing, | 禁止使用取水点洗车，
[04:25.30]or those inviting 'our camping friends' to a dance or a boat trip are printed not only in French or Italian or Spanish, but also in English, German and Dutch. | 或者邀请“我们的露营朋友”参加舞会或乘船游览的告示，不仅用法语、意大利语或西班牙语印制，也用英语、德语和荷兰语印制。
[04:37.99]At meal times the odour of sauerkraut vies with that of garlic. | 用餐时，酸菜味与大蒜味相互竞争。
[04:43.13]The Frenchman's breakfast coffee competes with the Englishman's bacon and eggs. | 法国人的早餐咖啡与英国人的培根鸡蛋相互抗衡。
[04:49.73]Whether the remarkable growth of organized camping means the eventual death of the more independent kind is hard to say. | 有组织的露营的显著增长是否意味着更独立露营方式的最终消亡，这很难说。
[04:58.15]Municipalities naturally want to secure the campers' site fees and other custom. | 市政府自然希望确保露营者的场地费和其他消费。
[05:04.09]Police are wary of itinerants who cannot be traced to a recognized camp boundary or to four walls. | 警方对那些无法追溯到已认可营地边界或有四面墙壁的流浪者保持警惕。
[05:12.15]But most probably it will all depend upon campers themselves: how many heath fires they cause; how much litter they leave; | 但最有可能的是，这一切都将取决于露营者自己：他们引发了多少荒地火灾；他们留下了多少垃圾；
[05:23.04]in short, whether or not they wholly alienate landowners and those who live in the countryside. | 简而言之，他们是否完全疏远了土地所有者和那些住在乡村的人。
[05:31.48]Only good scouting is likely to preserve the freedoms so dear to the heart of the eternal Boy Scout. | 只有良好的童子军精神才可能维护那些永恒的童子军心中珍爱的自由。
