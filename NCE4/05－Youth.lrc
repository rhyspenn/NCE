[00:20.18]If there is one -- which I take leave to doubt | 假如真有所谓“青年问题”——对此我不敢苟同
[00:24.26]-- then it is older people who create it, not the young themselves. | ——那么这个问题是由老年人造成的，而不是年轻人本身造成的。

[01:13.57]For one thing, being a problem gives you a certain identity, | 首先，成为一个“问题”会给你某种身份感，
[01:18.92]and that is one of the things the young are busily engaged in seeking. | 而这正是年轻人正在努力寻找的东西之一。

[01:42.97]All this seems to me to link them with life and the origins of things. | 这一切在我看来，都把他们与生命和万物本源联系在一起。
[01:49.63]It's as if they were in some sense cosmic beings in violent and lovely contrast with us suburban creatures. | 仿佛他们在某种意义上是宇宙生灵，与我们这些市郊凡夫俗子形成强烈而可爱的对比。
