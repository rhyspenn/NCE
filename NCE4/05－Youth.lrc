[00:09.33]How does the writer like to treat young people? | 作者喜欢如何对待年轻人？
[00:14.44]People are always talking about 'the problem of youth'. | 人们总是在谈论“青年问题”。
[00:20.18]If there is one -- which I take leave to doubt | 假如真有所谓“青年问题”——对此我不敢苟同
[00:24.26]-- then it is older people who create it, not the young themselves. | ——那么这个问题是由老年人造成的，而不是年轻人本身造成的。
[00:29.98]Let us get down to fundamentals and agree that the young are after all human beings | 让我们回归基本事实，承认年轻人毕竟也是人
[00:36.74]-- people just like their elders. | ——和他们的长辈一样的人。

[00:45.00]the young man has a glorious future before him | 年轻人面前是光辉灿烂的未来
[00:48.85]and the old one has a splendid future behind him: and maybe that is where the rub is. | 而老年人身后是辉煌的过去：也许症结就在这里。
[00:57.12]When I was a teenager, I felt that I was just young and uncertain -- | 当我还是个少年时，我觉得自己只是年轻和不确定——
[01:03.42]that I was a new boy in a huge school, | 我就像一个庞大校园里的新生，
[01:06.66]and I would have been very pleased to be regarded as something so interesting as a problem. | 如果被看作是像“问题”一样有趣的东西，我一定会非常高兴。
[01:13.57]For one thing, being a problem gives you a certain identity, | 首先，成为一个“问题”会给你某种身份感，
[01:18.92]and that is one of the things the young are busily engaged in seeking. | 而这正是年轻人正在努力寻找的东西之一。
[01:24.14]I find young people exciting. | 我觉得年轻人令人兴奋。

[01:35.47]They are not anxious social climbers, and they have no devotion to material things. | 他们不是焦虑的社会攀爬者，他们对物质也没有任何执着。
[01:42.97]All this seems to me to link them with life and the origins of things. | 这一切在我看来，都把他们与生命和万物本源联系在一起。
[01:49.63]It's as if they were in some sense cosmic beings in violent and lovely contrast with us suburban creatures. | 仿佛他们在某种意义上是宇宙生灵，与我们这些市郊凡夫俗子形成强烈而可爱的对比。
[01:59.57]All that is in my mind when I meet a young person. | 当我遇到一个年轻人时，我心里想的就是这些。
[02:04.36]He may be conceited, ill-mannered, presumptuous or fatuous, but I do not turn for protection to dreary cliches about respect for elders -- | 他可能自负、粗鲁、傲慢或愚蠢，但我不会用那些关于尊重长辈的陈词滥调来为自己辩护——
[02:16.79]as if mere age were a reason for respect. | 仿佛仅仅年龄就是值得尊重的理由。
[02:21.38]I accept that we are equals, and I will argue with him, as an equal, if I think he is wrong. | 我承认我们是平等的，如果我认为他错了，我会以平等的身份与他争辩。
