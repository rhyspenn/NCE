[00:02.96]The hovercraft | 气垫船
[00:10.31]What is a hovercraft riding on when it is in motion? | 气垫船开动时，它骑在什么上面？
[00:16.55]Many strange new means of transport have been developed in our century, | 本世纪人们发明了许多稀奇古怪的交通工具，
[00:22.29]the strangest of them being perhaps the hovercraft. | 其中最奇特的也许要算是气垫船了。
[00:27.29]In 1953, a former electronics engineer in his fifties, Christopher Cockerell, | 1953年，一位50多岁、曾任电子工程师的克里斯托弗·科克雷尔，
[00:35.44]who had turned to boat-building on the Norfolk Broads, | 他已转行在诺福克湖区制造船只，
[00:39.52]suggested an idea on which he had been working for many years to the British Government and industrial circles. | 他把多年来一直致力于研究的一种设想，呈报给了英国政府和工业界。
[00:48.13]It was the idea of supporting a craft on a 'pad', or cushion, of low-pressure air, ringed with a curtain of higher pressure air. | 他的设想是：让航行器由一个低压气垫支撑，气垫四周由一道高压空气幕环绕。
[01:00.20]Ever since, people have had difficulty in deciding whether the craft should be ranged among ships, planes, | 从那时起，人们就很难确定这种航行器究竟是船、是飞机，
[01:09.38]or land vehicles--for it is something in between a boat and an aircraft. | 还是陆上交通工具——因为它介于船和飞机之间。
[01:17.57]As a shipbuilder, Cockerell was trying to find a solution to the problem of the wave resistance which wastes a good deal of a surface ship's power and limits its speed. | 作为一名造船工程师，科克雷尔当时正试图解决波浪阻力问题，波浪阻力消耗了水面船只的大部分动力，并限制了它的航速。
[01:31.54]His answer was to lift the vessel out of the water by making it ride on a cushion of air, no more than one or two feet thick. | 他的答案是让船只骑在厚度不超过一两英尺的气垫上，从而使其脱离水面。
[01:42.60]This is done by a great number of ring-shaped air jets on the bottom of the craft. | 这是通过航行器底部大量的环形喷气口完成的。
[01:49.60]It 'flies', therefore, but it cannot fly higher--its action depends on the surface, water or ground, over which it rides. | 因此它“飞行”，但不能飞得更高——它的运行依赖于它所行驶的水面或地面。
[02:02.29]The first tests on the Solent in 1959 caused a sensation. | 1959年在索伦特海峡进行的首次试验引起了轰动。
[02:08.57]The hovercraft travelled first over the water, then mounted the beach, climbed up the dunes, and sat down on a road. | 气垫船先是在水面上行驶，然后登上沙滩，爬上沙丘，最后停在一条公路上。
[02:19.57]Later it crossed the Channel, riding smoothly over the waves, which presented no problem. | 后来它穿越了英吉利海峡，平稳地在海浪上行驶，这没有造成任何问题。
[02:28.89]Since that time, various types of hovercraft have appeared and taken up regular service. | 从那时起，各种型号的气垫船相继问世，并投入了定期运营。
[02:36.31]The hovercraft is particularly useful in large areas with poor communications such as Africa or Australia; | 气垫船在非洲或澳大利亚等交通不便的广大地区尤其有用；
[02:44.82]it can become a 'flying fruit-bowl', carrying bananas from the plantations to the ports; | 它可以变成一个“飞行水果盘”，将香蕉从种植园运到港口；
[02:51.89]giant hovercraft liners could span the Atlantic; | 巨型气垫船班轮可以横跨大西洋；
[02:55.67]and the railway of the future may well be the 'hovertrain', | 而未来的铁路很可能就是“气垫列车”，
[02:59.99]riding on its air cushion over a single rail, which it never touches, at speeds, up to 300 m.p.h.--the possibilities appear unlimited. | 它们在单轨上方的气垫上行驶，永不接触轨道，时速可达300英里——其可能性似乎无限。
