[00:02.28]Royal espionage | 王室谍报
[00:11.31]What important thing did King Alfred learn when he penetrated the Danish camp of Guthrum? | 阿尔弗雷德国王潜入古特伦的丹麦营地时学到了什么重要的东西？
[00:20.72]Alfred the Great acted as his own spy, visiting Danish camps disguised as a minstrel. | 阿尔弗雷德大帝亲自充当间谍，乔装成吟游诗人，拜访丹麦营地。
[00:29.54]In those days wandering minstrels were welcome everywhere. | 在那些日子里，四处游荡的吟游诗人在任何地方都受到欢迎。
[00:34.45]They were not fighting men, and their harp was their passport. | 他们不是战士，他们的竖琴就是他们的通行证。
[00:39.20]Alfred had learned many of their ballads in his youth and could vary his programme with acrobatic tricks and simple conjuring. | 阿尔弗雷德年轻时学过许多他们的民谣，并能通过杂技表演和简单的魔术来丰富他的节目。
[00:49.17]While Alfred's little army slowly began to gather at Athelney, the king himself set out to penetrate the camp of Guthrum, the commander of the Danish invaders. | 当阿尔弗雷德的小部队在阿瑟尔尼缓慢集结时，国王亲自出发，潜入丹麦入侵者指挥官古特伦的营地。
[01:02.26]These had settled down for the winter at Chippenham: thither Alfred went. | 他们在奇彭纳姆安顿下来过冬，阿尔弗雷德也去了那里。
[01:09.32]He noticed at once that discipline was slack: the Danes had the self-confidence of conquerors, and their security precautions were casual. | 他立刻注意到纪律松懈：丹麦人有征服者的自信，他们的安全防范措施很随意。
[01:21.06]They lived well, on the proceeds of raids on neighbouring regions. | 他们靠掠夺邻近地区的收益过着富裕的生活。
[01:26.77]There they collected women as well as food and drink, and a life of ease had made them soft. | 他们在那里搜罗了妇女、食物和饮料，安逸的生活使他们变得软弱。
[01:34.89]Alfred stayed in the camp a week before he returned to Athelney. | 阿尔弗雷德在营地待了一周才返回阿瑟尔尼。
[01:40.13]The force there assembled was trivial compared with the Danish horde. | 在那里集结的部队与丹麦大军相比微不足道。
[01:45.12]But Alfred had deduced that the Danes were no longer fit for prolonged battle: and that their commissariat had no organization, but depended on irregular raids. | 但阿尔弗雷德推断丹麦人已不再适合持久战，而且他们的军需供应没有组织，只依赖于不规律的突袭。
[01:58.52]So, faced with the Danish advance, Alfred did not risk open battle but harried the enemy. | 因此，面对丹麦人的进攻，阿尔弗雷德没有冒险进行公开战斗，而是骚扰敌人。
[02:06.57]He was constantly on the move, drawing the Danes after him. | 他不断移动，将丹麦人吸引到他身后。
[02:11.58]His patrols halted the raiding parties: hunger assailed the Danish army. | 他的巡逻队阻止了突袭队伍：饥饿侵袭着丹麦军队。
[02:17.97]Now Alfred began a long series of skirmishes -- and within a month the Danes had surrendered. | 接着，阿尔弗雷德开始了一系列漫长的遭遇战——一个月内丹麦人就投降了。
[02:25.74]The episode could reasonably serve as a unique epic of royal espionage! | 这一事件完全可以作为一场独特的王室谍报史诗！
