[00:02.76]The sculptor speaks | 雕塑家说
[00:10.95]What do you have to be able to do to appreciate sculpture? | 要欣赏雕塑，你必须具备什么能力？
[00:17.35]Appreciation of sculpture depends upon the ability to respond to form in 3 dimensions. | 欣赏雕塑取决于能够感知三维形态的能力。
[00:25.69]That is perhaps why sculpture has been described as the most difficult of all arts; | 这也许就是为什么雕塑被描述为所有艺术中最难的；
[00:32.10]certainly it is more difficult than the arts which involve appreciation of flat forms, shape in only two dimensions. | 当然，它比那些涉及欣赏平面形态（仅二维形状）的艺术要难。
[00:41.91]Many more people are 'form-blind' than colour-blind. | 相比色盲，更多的人是“形盲”。
[00:48.46]The child learning to see, first distinguishes only two-dimensional shape; it cannot judge distances, depths. | 孩子在学习看东西时，首先只能辨别二维形状；它无法判断距离和深度。
[00:57.88]Later, for its personal safety and practical needs, it has to develop (partly by means of touch) the ability to judge roughly 3-dimensonal distances. | 后来，为了自身的安全和实际需要，它必须培养（部分通过触摸）粗略判断三维距离的能力。
[01:11.81]But having satisfied the requirements of practical necessity, most people go no further. | 但是，在满足了实际需要的要求之后，大多数人就不会再深入了。
[01:18.94]Though they may attain considerable accuracy in the perception of flat form, | 尽管他们可能在感知平面形态方面达到相当高的准确度，
[01:24.99]they do not make the further intellectual and emotional effort needed to comprehend form in its full spatial existence. | 但他们不会付出进一步的智力和情感努力，来理解形态的完整空间存在。
[01:35.23]This is what the sculptor must do. | 这就是雕塑家必须做的事情。
[01:38.04]He must strive continually to think of and use, form in its full spatial completeness. | 他必须不断努力思考和运用形态的完整空间性。
[01:46.88]He gets the solid shape as it were, inside his head--he thinks of it, whatever its size, as if he were holding it completely enclosed in the hollow of his hand. | 他仿佛将固体形状置于脑中——无论大小，他都将其视作完全握在掌中。
[02:00.70]He mentally visualizes a complex form from all round itself; | 他在脑海中从各个方向观察复杂的形态；
[02:07.30]he knows while he looks at one side what the other side is like; he identifies himself with its centre of gravity, its mass, its weight; | 当他看一面时，他就知道另一面是什么样子；他将自己与它的重心、质量、重量联系起来；
[02:18.34]he realizes its volume as the space that the shape displaces in the air. | 他将它的体积理解为形状在空气中排开的空间。
[02:24.81]And the sensitive observer of sculpture must also learn to feel shape simply as shape, not as description or reminiscence. | 并且，敏感的雕塑观察者也必须学会将形状单纯地感受为形状，而不是描述或回忆。
[02:34.47]He must, for example, perceive an egg as a simple single solid shape quite apart from its significance as food, | 例如，他必须将一个鸡蛋视为一个简单、单一的固体形状，完全脱离它作为食物的意义，
[02:44.43]or from the literary idea that it will become a bird. | 或脱离它会变成一只鸟的文学观念。
[02:49.08]And so with solids such as a shell, a nut, a plum, a pear, a tadpole, a mushroom, | 对于诸如贝壳、坚果、李子、梨、蝌蚪、蘑菇、
[02:58.09]a mountain peak, a kidney, a carrot, a tree-trunk, a bird, a bud, a lark, a ladybird, a bulrush, a bone. | 山峰、肾脏、胡萝卜、树干、鸟、花蕾、百灵鸟、瓢虫、香蒲、骨头等固体也是如此。
[03:11.28]From these he can go on to appreciate more complex forms or combinations of several forms. | 从这些事物中，他可以进一步欣赏更复杂的形态或多种形态的组合。
