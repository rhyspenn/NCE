[01:02.67]is to make your interests gradually wider and more impersonal, | 是使你的兴趣逐渐扩大，变得更加超然物外，

[01:13.22]and your life becomes increasingly merged in the universal life. | 你的生命越来越融入到普遍的生命之中。
[01:17.73]An individual human existence should be like a river-- | 人的个体生命应该像一条河流——
[01:23.51]small at first, narrowly contained within its banks, | 最初很小，被狭窄的河岸限制着，
[01:28.42]and rushing passionately past boulders and over waterfalls. | 汹涌地冲过巨石，飞跃瀑布。
[01:33.70]Gradually the river grows wider, the banks recede, the waters flow more quietly, | 渐渐地，河流变得宽阔，河岸后退，水流也变得更加平静，
[01:41.18]and in the end, without any visiblebreak, they become merged in the sea, | 最终，在没有任何明显的断裂的情况下，它们汇入了大海，
[01:47.44]and painlessly lose their individual being. | 并且毫无痛苦地失去了它们的个体存在。

[01:56.77]will not suffer from the fear of death, | 将不会受到对死亡的恐惧的折磨，
[01:59.54]since the things he cares for will continue. | 因为他所珍视的一切将会继续存在。
