[00:02.34]Patients and doctors | 病人与医生
[00:09.46]What are patients looking for when they visit the doctor? | 病人看医生时在寻找什么？
[00:14.79]This is a sceptical age, | 这是一个怀疑的时代，
[00:16.94]but although our faith in many of the things in which our forefathers fervently believed has weakened, | 尽管我们对先辈们曾笃信的许多事物的信念已动摇，
[00:23.70]our confidence in the curative properties of the bottle of medicine remains the same as theirs. | 但我们对瓶装药物疗效的信心却和他们一样坚定。
[00:30.52]This modern faith in medicines is proved by the fact | 对药物的这种现代信念由以下事实得到证明：
[00:34.23]that the annual drug bill of the Health Services is mounting to astronomical figures. | 医疗服务机构每年的药品费用正在攀升至天文数字，
[00:40.51]and shows no signs at present of ceasing to rise. | 而且目前没有停止增长的迹象。
[00:45.25]The majority of the patients attending the medical out-patients departments of our hospitals feel that | 在我们医院门诊部就诊的大多数病人觉得，
[00:51.22]they have not received adequate treatment unless they are able to carry home with them | 除非他们能带回家一些
[00:56.22]some tangible remedy in the shape of a bottle of medicine, | 具体可见的治疗方法，比如一瓶药水、
[01:00.29]a box of pills, or a small jar of ointment, | 一盒药片或一小罐药膏，
[01:04.21]and the doctor in charge of the department is only too ready to provide them with these requirements. | 否则他们就没有得到充分的治疗。而负责该部门的医生也非常乐意满足他们的这些要求。
[01:10.98]There is no quicker method of disposing of patients than by giving them what they are asking for, | 没有比给病人他们所要求的东西更能迅速打发他们的方法了，
[01:17.30]and since most medical men in the Health Services are overworked | 而且由于医疗服务机构的大多数医务人员工作过度，
[01:21.58]and have little time for offering time-consuming and little-appreciated advice on such subjects as diet, | 很少有时间提供耗时且不被重视的建议，比如关于饮食、
[01:29.10]right living, and the need for abandoning bad habits etc., | 正确生活方式以及改掉坏习惯等，
[01:33.81]the bottle, the box, and the jar are almost always granted them. | 所以药水、药片和药膏几乎总是会给他们。
[01:39.03]Nor is it only the ignorant and ill-educated person who has such faith in the bottle of medicine. | 并非只有无知和受教育程度不高的人才对瓶装药水有如此大的信心。
[01:45.79]It is recounted of Thomas Carlyle that when he heard of the illness of his friend, Henry Taylor, | 据记载，托马斯·卡莱尔听说他的朋友亨利·泰勒生病时，
[01:52.98]he went off immediately to visit him, | 立刻前去探望他，
[01:55.99]carrying with him in his pocket what remained a bottle of medicine formerly prescribed for an indisposition of Mrs. Carlyle's. | 口袋里带着一瓶他妻子卡莱尔夫人以前因病服用后剩下的药水。
[02:06.16]Carlyle was entirely ignorant of what the bottle in his pocket contained, | 卡莱尔完全不知道他口袋里的药瓶装着什么，
[02:11.22]of the nature of the illness from which his friend was suffering, | 也不知道他的朋友患的是什么病，
[02:15.02]and of what had previously been wrong with his wife, | 更不知道他妻子以前得了什么病，
[02:18.70]but a medicine that had worked so well in one form of illness would surely be of equal benefit in another, | 但他认为一种疾病疗效显著的药，对另一种病也肯定同样有效，
[02:25.88]and comforted by the thought of the help he was bringing to his friend, | 想到他能给朋友带来帮助，便感到欣慰，
[02:30.16]he hastened to Henry Taylor's house. | 于是他匆匆赶往亨利·泰勒家。
[02:33.66]History does not relate whether his friend accepted his medical help, but in all probability he did. | 历史上没有记载他的朋友是否接受了他的医疗帮助，但很可能他接受了。
[02:40.74]The great advantage of taking medicine is that it makes no demands on the taker | 服药的最大优点在于它对服药者没有任何要求，
[02:45.65]beyond that of putting up for a moment with a disgusting taste, | 除了忍受一小会儿难闻的味道之外，
[02:49.86]and that is what all patients demand of their doctors--to be cured at no inconvenience to themselves. | 而这正是所有病人对医生提出的要求——在自己不感到任何不便的情况下被治愈。
