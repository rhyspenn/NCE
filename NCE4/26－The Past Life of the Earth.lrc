[00:03.68]The past life of the earth | 地球上的过去生命
[00:09.22]What is the main condition for the preservation of the remains of any living creature? | 任何生物遗骸得以保存的主要条件是什么？
[00:17.59]It is animals and plants which lived in or near water whose remains are most likely to be preserved, | 生活在水里或水边的动植物遗骸最有可能被保存下来，
[00:24.49]for one of the necessary conditions of preservation is quick burial, | 因为保存的必要条件之一是快速掩埋，
[00:30.40]and it is only in the seas and rivers, and sometimes lakes, | 而只有在海洋、河流以及有时湖泊中，
[00:34.84]where mud and silt have been continuously deposited, | 泥沙不断沉积的地方，
[00:38.72]that bodies and the like can be rapidly covered over and preserved. | 尸体和类似的东西才能迅速被覆盖并保存下来。
[00:44.25]But even in the most favourable circumstances | 但即使在最有利的条件下，
[00:47.63]only a small fraction of the creatures that die are preserved in this way | 只有一小部分死去的生物能以这种方式保存下来，
[00:52.96]before decay sets in or, even more likely, before scavengers eat them. | 在腐烂发生之前，或者更有可能，在食腐动物吃掉它们之前。
[00:59.09]After all, all living creatures live by feeding on something else, | 毕竟，所有生物都靠捕食其他生物而生，
[01:03.71]whether it be plant or animal, dead or alive, | 无论是植物还是动物，死的还是活的，
[01:07.51]and it is only by chance that such a fate is avoided. | 只有偶然才能避免这种命运。
[01:11.65]The remains of plants and animals that lived on land are much more rarely preserved, | 生活在陆地上的动植物遗骸保存下来的情况要少得多，
[01:17.26]for there is seldom anything to cover them over. | 因为很少有什么东西能覆盖它们。
[01:20.71]When you think of the innumerable birds that one sees flying about, | 当你想到无数飞来飞去的鸟儿，
[01:25.56]not to mention the equally numerous small animals like field mice and voles which you do not see, | 更不用说你看不见的同样多的像田鼠和田鼠这样的小动物，
[01:32.76]it is very rarely that one comes across a dead body, except, of course, on the roads. | 你很少会碰到一具尸体，当然除了在路上。
[01:39.14]They decompose and are quickly destroyed by the weather or eaten by some other creature. | 它们会分解，很快被天气破坏或被其他生物吃掉。
[01:46.22]It is almost always due to some very special circumstances that traces of land animals survive, | 陆地动物的痕迹几乎总是由于某些非常特殊的情况而得以幸存，
[01:53.83]as by falling into inaccessible caves, or into an ice crevasse, | 比如掉进难以进入的洞穴，或者掉进冰裂缝，
[01:59.26]like the Siberian mammoths, | 就像西伯利亚猛犸象一样，
[02:01.40]when the whole animal is sometimes preserved, as in a refrigerator. | 有时整个动物都被保存下来，就像放在冰箱里一样。
[02:06.58]This is what happened to the famous Beresovka mammoth which was found preserved and in good condition. | 著名的别列佐夫卡猛犸象就是这样，它被发现时保存完好。
[02:13.76]In his mouth were the remains of fir trees--the last meal that he had before he fell into the crevasse and broke his back. | 它的嘴里有杉树的残骸——这是它掉进裂缝摔断背之前的最后一餐。
[02:23.19]The mammoth has now been restored in the Palaeontological Museum in St.Petersburg. | 这头猛犸象现已在圣彼得堡的古生物博物馆修复。
[02:29.60]Other animals were trapped in tar pits, like the elephants, sabre-toothed cats, | 其他动物被困在沥青坑里，比如大象、剑齿虎，
[02:35.46]and numerous other creatures that are found at Rancho la Brea, which is now just a suburb of Los Angeles. | 以及在拉布雷亚牧场发现的无数其他生物，那里现在只是洛杉矶的一个郊区。
[02:43.22]Apparently what happened was that water collected on these tar pits | 显然，这些沥青坑上积水了，
[02:48.29]and the bigger animals like the elephants ventured out on to the apparently firm surface to drink, | 像大象这样的大型动物冒险走到看似坚实的表面去饮水，
[02:55.69]and were promptly bogged in the tar. | 随即被困在沥青中。
[02:58.49]And then, when they were dead, the carnivores, | 然后，当它们死去后，食肉动物，
[03:01.94]like the sabretoothed cats and the giant wolves, | 比如剑齿虎和巨型狼，
[03:05.48]came out to feed and suffered exactly the same fate. | 出来捕食，也遭受了同样的命运。
[03:10.68]There are also endless numbers of birds in the tar as well. | 沥青中也有无数的鸟类。
