[00:02.70]The stuff of dreams | 梦的本质
[00:10.86]What is going on when a person experiences rapid eye-movements during sleep? | 一个人在睡眠中经历快速眼动时发生了什么？
[00:18.37]It is fairly clear that the sleeping period must have some function, and because there is so much of it the function would seem to be important. | 很清楚，睡眠期一定有某种功能，而且由于睡眠期很长，这种功能似乎很重要。
[00:28.71]Speculations about its nature have been going on for literally thousands of years, | 关于其本质的猜测已经持续了几千年，
[00:35.16]and one odd finding that makes the problem puzzling is that it looks very much as if sleeping is not simply a matter of giving the body a rest. | 一个令人困惑的奇怪发现是，睡眠似乎不仅仅是让身体休息。
[00:45.36]'Rest', in terms of muscle relaxation and so on, can be achieved by a brief period lying, or even sitting down. | 从肌肉放松等方面来看，“休息”可以通过短暂的躺卧，甚至坐下来实现。
[00:55.75]The body's tissues are self-repairing and self-restoring to a degree, and function best when more or less continuously active. | 身体的组织在一定程度上是自我修复和自我恢复的，并且在或多或少持续活动时功能最佳。
[01:06.27]In fact a basic amount of movement occurs during sleep which is specifically concerned with preventing muscle inactivity. | 事实上，在睡眠期间会发生一定程度的运动，这尤其旨在防止肌肉不活动。
[01:15.66]If it is not a question of resting the body, then perhaps it is the brain that needs resting? | 如果不是身体休息的问题，那么也许是大脑需要休息？
[01:23.65]This might be a plausible hypothesis were it not for two factors. | 要不是有两个因素，这可能是一个合理的假设。
[01:29.37]First the electroencephalograph (which is simply a device for recording the electrical activity of the brain by attaching electrodes to the scalp) | 首先，脑电图仪（它只是一种通过将电极连接到头皮来记录大脑电活动的设备）
[01:40.75]shows that while there is a change in the pattern of activity during sleep, | 表明虽然睡眠期间的活动模式有所变化，
[01:45.80]there is no evidence that the total amount of activity is any less. | 但没有证据表明总活动量有所减少。
[01:51.36]The second factor is more interesting and more fundamental. | 第二个因素更有趣也更具根本性。
[01:56.00]Some years ago an American psychiatrist named William Dement published experiments dealing with the recording of eye-movements during sleep. | 几年前，一位名叫威廉·德门特的美国精神病学家发表了关于记录睡眠期间眼球运动的实验。
[02:06.91]He showed that the average individual's sleep cycle is punctuated with peculiar bursts of eye-movements, some drifting and slow, others jerky and rapid. | 他表明，普通人的睡眠周期会伴随着奇特的眼球运动爆发，有些是漂移而缓慢的，有些是抽搐而快速的。
[02:20.33]People woken during these periods of eye-movements generally reported that they had been dreaming. | 在这些眼球运动期间被唤醒的人通常报告说他们一直在做梦。
[02:26.91]When woken at other times they reported no dreams. | 而在其他时候被唤醒时，他们报告说没有做梦。
[02:30.85]If one group of people were disturbed from their eye-movement sleep for several nights on end, | 如果一组人在连续几个晚上被从眼动睡眠中打扰，
[02:36.30]and another group were disturbed for an equal period of time but when they were not exhibiting eye-movements, | 而另一组人在相同的时间内被打扰，但当时他们没有表现出眼球运动，
[02:45.44]the first group began to show some personality disorders while the others seemed more or less unaffected. | 第一组人开始表现出一些人格障碍，而其他人则或多或少地未受影响。
[02:54.88]The implications of all this were that it was not the disturbance of sleep that mattered, but the disturbance of dreaming. | 所有这些都表明，重要的不是睡眠受到干扰，而是做梦受到干扰。
