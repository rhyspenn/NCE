[00:02.59]Finding fossil man | 寻找化石人
[00:10.90]Why are legends handed down by storytellers useful? | 说书人世代相传的传说为什么有用？
[00:17.43]We can read of things that happened 5, 000 years ago in the Near East, | 我们能读到5000年前近东发生的事，
[00:23.28]where people first learned to write. | 那里的人们最早学会了书写。
[00:26.92]But there are some parts of the world where even now people cannot write. | 但世界上的某些地方，即使到现在，人们仍然不会书写。
[00:33.40]The only way that they can preserve their history is to recount it as sagas legends handed down from one generation of storytellers to another. | 他们保存历史的唯一方法，就是把一代代说书人流传下来的史诗故事讲述出来。
[00:46.15]These legends are useful because they can tell us something about migrations of people who lived long ago, | 这些传说很有用，因为它们能告诉我们一些关于远古人类迁徙的信息，
[00:54.22]but none could write down what they did. | 但没有人能记录下他们的所作所为。
[00:57.67]Anthropologists wondered where the remote ancestors of the Polynesian peoples now living in the Pacific Islandscame from. | 人类学家们想知道，如今居住在太平洋岛屿上的波利尼西亚人的远古祖先来自何方。
[01:06.91]The sagas of these people explain that some of them came from Indonesia about 2, 000 years ago. | 这些人的史诗记载，他们中的一部分人大约在2000年前从印度尼西亚迁徙而来。
[01:15.26]But the first people who were like ourselves lived so long ago that even their sagas, if they had any, are forgotten. | 但是，第一批与我们相似的人类生活在如此久远的年代，以至于即使他们曾有史诗，也早已被遗忘。
[01:25.71]So archaeologists have neither history nor legends to help them to find out where the first 'modern men' came from. | 因此，考古学家既没有历史记载，也没有传说来帮助他们找出第一批“现代人”的起源。
[01:34.84]Fortunately, however, ancient men made tools of stone, especially flint, | 然而，幸运的是，远古人类制造了石器，尤其是燧石工具，
[01:41.45]because this is easier to shape than other kinds. | 因为它比其他种类的材料更容易塑形。
[01:45.74]They may also have used wood and skins, but these have rotted away. | 他们也可能使用过木头和兽皮，但这些都已经腐烂殆尽了。
[01:52.16]Stone does not decay, and so the tools of long ago have remained when even the bones of the men who made them have disappeared without trace. | 石头不会腐烂，因此，即使制造这些工具的人的骨骸早已消失得无影无踪，远古的石器工具依然留存至今。
