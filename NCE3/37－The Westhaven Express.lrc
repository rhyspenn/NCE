[00:02.10]The Westhaven Express | 韦斯特黑文特快
[00:08.86]What was the mistake the author made? | 作者犯了什么错误？
[00:14.04]We have learnt to expect that trains will be punctual. | 我们已经习惯了认为火车是准时的。
[00:18.46]After years of conditioning, most of us have developed an unshakable faith in railway timetables. | 经过多年的条件反射，我们大多数人对火车时刻表都产生了不可动摇的信任。
[00:26.14]Ships may be delayed by storms; | 船只可能因风暴而延误；
[00:28.93]flights may be cancelled because of bad weather; but trains must be on time. | 航班可能因恶劣天气而取消；但火车必须准时。
[00:35.90]Only an exceptionally heavy snow fall might temporarily dislocate railway services. | 只有异常大的降雪才可能暂时打乱铁路服务。
[00:43.33]It is all too easy to blame the railway authorities when something does go wrong. | 当事情出错时，责备铁路当局实在是太容易了。
[00:49.57]The truth is that when mistakes occur, they are more likely to be ours than theirs. | 事实是，当错误发生时，它们更有可能是我们的，而不是他们的。
[00:56.76]After consulting my railway timetable, I noted with satisfaction that there was an express train to Westhaven. | 查阅了我的火车时刻表后，我满意地注意到有一趟开往韦斯特黑文的特快列车。
[01:06.00]It went direct from my local station and the journey lasted a mere hour and seventeen minutes. | 它直接从我当地的车站出发，行程仅需一小时十七分钟。
[01:13.55]When I boarded the train, I could not help noticing that a great many local people got on as well. | 当我登上火车时，我不禁注意到许多当地人也上车了。
[01:21.11]At the time, this did not strike me as odd. | 当时，这并没有让我觉得奇怪。
[01:24.97]I reflected that there must be a great many people besides myself who wished to take advantage of this excellent service. | 我想，除了我自己之外，肯定有很多人也希望利用这项优质服务。
[01:33.31]Neither was I surprised when the train stopped at Widley, a tiny station a few miles along the line. | 当火车在离铁路线几英里外的一个小站威德利停靠时，我也没有感到惊讶。
[01:41.74]Even a mighty express train can be held up by signals. | 即使是强大的特快列车也可能被信号灯拦住。
[01:45.94]But when the train dawdled at station after station, I began to wonder. | 但当火车在一个又一个车站磨蹭时，我开始感到疑惑。
[01:52.11]It suddenly dawned on me that this express was not roaring down the line at ninety miles an hour, but barely chugging along at thirty. | 我突然意识到，这趟特快列车并不是以每小时九十英里的速度呼啸而过，而是以每小时三十英里的速度缓慢行驶。
[02:02.90]One hour and seventeen minutes passed and we had not even covered half the distance. | 一小时十七分钟过去了，我们甚至还没有走完一半的路程。
[02:09.85]I asked a passenger if this was the Westhaven Express, but he had not even heard of it. | 我问一位乘客这是否是韦斯特黑文特快，但他甚至没有听说过。
[02:16.56]I determined to lodge a complaint as soon as we arrived. | 我决定一到站就投诉。
[02:21.06]Two hours later, I was talking angrily to the station master at Westhaven. | 两个小时后，我正在韦斯特黑文车站愤怒地与站长交谈。
[02:27.30]When he denied the train's existence, I borrowed his copy of the timetable. | 当他否认这趟火车存在时，我借了他的时刻表。
[02:33.44]There was a note of triumph in my voice when I told him that it was there in black and white. | 当我告诉他白纸黑字写着时，我的声音带着一丝胜利。
[02:40.49]Glancing at it briefly, he told me to look again. | 他简短地瞥了一眼，然后告诉我再看一次。
[02:45.15]A tiny asterisk conducted me to a footnote at the bottom of the page. | 一个小小的星号引导我看到了页面底部的脚注。
[02:50.96]It said: 'This service has been suspended.' | 它写着：“此项服务已暂停。”
