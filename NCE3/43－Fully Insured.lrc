[00:03.01]Fully insured | 全额投保
[00:10.94]Who owned the pie dish and why? | 馅饼盘属于谁，为什么？
[00:15.55]Insurance companies are normally willing to insure anything. | 保险公司通常愿意为任何东西投保。
[00:20.85]Insuring public or private property is a standard practice in most countries in the world. | 在世界上大多数国家，为公共或私人财产投保是一种惯例。
[00:28.14]If, however, you were holding an open air garden party or a fete it would be equally possible to insure yourself in the event of bad weather. | 然而，如果你要举办一场露天花园派对或游园会，同样可以为自己投保，以防恶劣天气。
[00:40.27]Needless to say, the bigger the risk an insurance company takes, the higher the premium you will have to pay. | 不言而喻，保险公司承担的风险越大，你将支付的保费就越高。
[00:49.90]It is not uncommon to hear that a shipping company has made a claim for the cost of salvaging a sunken ship. | 航运公司为打捞沉船的费用提出索赔并非罕见。
[00:58.02]But the claim made by a local authority to recover the cost of salvaging a sunken pie dish must surely be unique. | 但地方当局为打捞沉没的馅饼盘而提出的索赔，肯定是非同寻常的。
[01:08.34]Admittedly it was an unusual pie dish, for it was eighteen feet long and six feet wide. | 诚然，这是一个不寻常的馅饼盘，因为它有18英尺长，6英尺宽。
[01:17.40]It had been purchased by a local authority so that an enormous pie could be baked for an annual fair. | 它是由地方当局购买的，以便为一年一度的集市烤制一个巨大的馅饼。
[01:26.40]The pie committee decided that the best way to transport the dish would be by canal so they insured it for the trip. | 馅饼委员会决定，运输这个盘子的最好方式是水路，所以他们为这次行程投了保。
[01:36.61]Shortly after it was launched, the pie committee went to a local inn to celebrate. | 盘子下水后不久，馅饼委员会就去了一家当地的旅店庆祝。
[01:43.28]At the same time, a number of teenagers climbed on to the dish and held a little party of their own. | 同时，一些青少年爬上盘子，开起了他们自己的小型派对。
[01:51.27]Dancing proved to be more than the dish could bear, | 跳舞对盘子来说是无法承受的，
[01:55.25]for during the party it capsized and sank in seven feet of water. | 因为在派对期间，它翻了船，沉入了七英尺深的水中。
[02:01.76]The pie committee telephoned a local garage owner who arrived in a recovery truck to salvage the pie dish. | 馅饼委员会给当地的一位修车厂老板打电话，他开着一辆救援卡车前来打捞馅饼盘。
[02:10.67]Shivering in their wet clothes, the teenagers looked on while three men dived repeatedly into the water to locate the dish. | 少年们穿着湿衣服颤抖着，看着三名男子反复潜入水中寻找盘子。
[02:21.41]They had little difficulty in finding it, but hauling it out of the water proved to be a serious problem. | 他们找到它几乎没什么困难，但把它从水中拖出来却是个大问题。
[02:30.27]The sides of the dish were so smooth that it was almost impossible to attach hawsers and chains to the rim without damaging it. | 盘子的侧面非常光滑，几乎不可能在不损坏它的情况下将缆绳和链条固定到边缘。
[02:42.12]Eventually chains were fixed to one end of the dish and a powerful winch was put into operation. | 最终，链条被固定在盘子的一端，一台强大的绞车开始工作。
[02:50.84]The dish rose to the surface and was gently drawn towards the canal bank. | 盘子浮出水面，被轻轻地拉向运河岸边。
[02:58.10]For one agonizing moment, the dish was perched precariously on the bank of the canal, | 有一刻，盘子摇摇晃晃地栖息在运河岸边，令人心焦，
[03:05.67]but it suddenly overbalanced and slid back into the water. | 但它突然失去平衡，滑回了水中。
[03:11.34]The men were now obliged to try once more. | 男人们现在不得不再次尝试。
[03:15.82]This time they fixed heavy metal clamps to both sides of the dish so that they could fasten the chains. | 这次他们在盘子的两边固定了沉重的金属夹，以便系上链条。
[03:24.77]The dish now had to be lifted vertically because one edge was resting against the side of the canal. | 盘子现在必须垂直吊起，因为一侧正抵着运河的侧面。
[03:32.23]The winch was again put into operation and one of the men started up the truck. | 绞车再次启动，其中一名男子发动了卡车。
[03:38.89]Several minutes later, the dish was successfully hauled above the surface of the water. | 几分钟后，盘子被成功地吊出水面。
[03:45.30]Water streamed in torrents over its sides with such force that it set up a huge wave in the canal. | 水从盘子两侧倾泻而下，力量之大，以至于在运河中掀起了巨浪。
[03:53.96]There was a danger that the wave would rebound off the other side of the bank and send the dish plunging into the water again. | 存在着波浪会从运河对岸反弹回来，再次将盘子冲入水中的危险。
[04:04.44]By working at tremendous speed, the men managed to get the dish on to dry land before the wave returned. | 男人们以惊人的速度工作，在波浪返回之前设法将盘子弄上了岸。
