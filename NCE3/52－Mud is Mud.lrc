[00:10.04]Why did Harry decide to give up his little game? | 哈里为什么决定放弃他那个小把戏呢？
[00:15.35]My cousin, Harry, keeps a large curiously-shaped bottle on permanent display in his study. | 我的表兄哈里在他书房里长期陈列着一个硕大而形状奇特的瓶子。
[00:23.47]Despite the fact that the bottle is tinted a delicate shade of green, | 尽管瓶子是淡绿色的，
[00:27.74]an observant visitor would soon notice that it is filled with what looks like a thick, greyish substance. | 细心的来访者很快就会注意到瓶子里盛满了像厚厚的灰白色物质。
[00:35.60]If you were to ask Harry what was in the bottle, he would tell you that it contained perfumed mud. | 如果你问哈里瓶子里装的是什么，他会告诉你里面装的是香泥。
[00:42.44]If you expressed doubt or surprise, he would immediately invite you to smell it and then to rub some into your skin. | 如果你表示怀疑或惊奇，他会立刻请你闻一闻，然后让你往皮肤上擦一些。
[00:52.01]The brief experiment would dispel any further doubts she might have. | 这一短暂的试验会打消你可能有的任何疑虑。

[01:09.36]Furthermore, the acquisition of this bottle cured him of a bad habit he had been developing for years. | 此外，得到这个瓶子还纠正了他多年来养成的一个坏习惯。
[01:17.66]Harry used to consider it a great joke to go into expensive cosmetic shops and make outrageous requests for goods that do not exist. | 哈里过去认为，到高级化妆品商店去提出一些闻所未闻的要求，寻找一些根本不存在的商品，是一种莫大的乐趣。
[01:28.92]He would invent fanciful names on the spot. | 他会当场编造一些新奇的名称。
[01:32.37]On entering a shop, | 一进商店，
[01:34.06]he would ask for a new perfume called 'Scented Shadow' or for 'insoluble bath cubes'. | 他会要求买一种叫“香影”的新型香水，或“不溶性浴块”。
[01:42.32]If a shop assistant told him she had not heard of it, he would pretend to be considerably put out. | 如果店员告诉他从未听说过，他便会装出相当不悦的样子。

[02:31.00]When the woman shook her head in bewilderment, | 当那个店员困惑地摇了摇头时，
[02:34.19]Harry went on to explain that 'myrolite' was a hard, amber-like substance which could be used to remove freckles. | 哈里接着解释说，“美妙来特”是一种硬的、琥珀状物质，可以用来消除雀斑。
[02:44.08]This explanation evidently conveyed something to the woman who searched shelf after shelf. | 这种解释显然使那个店员明白了一些什么，她便搜寻了一个又一个的货架。
[02:50.69]She produced all sorts of weird concoctions, but none of them met with Harry's requirements. | 她拿出了各种稀奇古怪的混合物，但没有一样符合哈里的要求。
[02:58.09]When Harry put on his act of being mildly annoyed, the assistant promised to order some for him. | 当哈里装出有点不高兴的样子时，店员答应为他订购一些。
[03:05.09]Intoxicated by his success, Harry then asked for perfumed mud. | 哈里成功后有点得意忘形，接着要买香泥。
[03:11.64]He expected the assistant to look at him in blank astonishment. | 他原以为店员会目瞪口呆地看着他。

[03:23.01]and she fetched several bottles which she placed on the counter for Harry to inspect. | 拿来了好几瓶放在柜台上让哈里检查。
[03:29.03]For once, Harry had to admit defeat. | 哈里只好承认这次是自己输了。
[03:32.65]He picked up what seemed to be the smallest bottle and discreetly asked the price. | 他拿起看似最小的一瓶，悄悄地问了问价格。
[03:39.30]He was glad to get away with a mere twenty pounds and he beat a hasty retreat, clutching the precious bottle under his arm. | 他庆幸只花了区区20英镑就脱身了，他赶忙溜走，把那瓶宝贝紧紧地夹在胳膊下。
[03:48.57]From then on, Harry decided that this little game he had invented might prove to be expensive. | 从那以后，哈里认为他发明的这个小把戏可能代价太大。
