[00:02.26]Instinct or cleverness? | 本能还是智慧？
[00:10.16]Was the writer successful in protecting his peach tree? Why not? | 作者成功保护了他的桃树吗？为什么没有？
[00:17.67]We have been brought up to fear insects. | 我们从小就被教导要害怕昆虫。
[00:20.65]We regard them as unnecessary creatures that do more harm than good. | 我们认为它们是多余的生物，弊大于利。
[00:26.54]We continually wage war on them, for they contaminate our food, carry diseases, or devour our crops. | 我们不断地与它们作斗争，因为它们会污染我们的食物，传播疾病，或吞噬我们的庄稼。
[00:35.76]They sting or bite without provocation; they fly uninvited into our rooms on summer nights, or beat against our lighted windows. | 它们无故蜇人或咬人；在夏天的夜晚，它们不请自来地飞进我们的房间，或拍打我们点亮的窗户。
[00:46.15]We live in dread not only of unpleasant insects like spiders or wasps, but of quite harmless ones like moths. | 我们不仅害怕蜘蛛或黄蜂等令人不快的昆虫，也害怕像飞蛾这样完全无害的昆虫。
[00:55.33]Reading about them increases our understanding without dispelling our fears. | 阅读有关它们的文章增加了我们的理解，却无法消除我们的恐惧。
[01:01.67]Knowing that the industrious ant lives in a highly organized society | 即使知道勤劳的蚂蚁生活在一个高度组织化的社会中，
[01:07.57]does nothing to prevent us from being filled with revulsion when we find hordes of them crawling over a carefully prepared picnic lunch. | 也无法阻止我们在一群蚂蚁爬满精心准备的野餐时感到厌恶。
[01:18.08]No matter how much we like honey, | 无论我们多么喜欢蜂蜜，
[01:20.89]or how much we have read about the uncanny sense of direction which bees possess, we have a horror of being stung. | 无论我们读过多少关于蜜蜂拥有不可思议的方向感，我们都害怕被蜇。
[01:30.32]Most of our fears are unreasonable, but they are impossible to erase. | 我们大部分的恐惧都是不合理的，但它们又难以消除。
[01:36.15]At the same time, however, insects are strangely fascinating. | 然而，与此同时，昆虫又有着奇特的魅力。
[01:41.48]We enjoy reading about them, especially when we find that, like the praying mantis, they lead perfectly horrible lives. | 我们喜欢阅读有关它们的文章，特别是当我们发现，像螳螂一样，它们过着极其可怕的生活时。
[01:51.10]We enjoy staring at them, entranced as they go about their business, unaware (we hope) of our presence. | 我们喜欢凝视它们，着迷地看着它们忙碌，希望它们没有察觉到我们的存在。
[01:59.91]Who has not stood in awe at the sight of a spider pouncing on a fly, | 谁不曾敬畏地看着蜘蛛扑向苍蝇，
[02:04.96]or a column of ants triumphantly bearing home an enormous dead beetle? | 或一队蚂蚁凯旋地将一只巨大的死甲虫搬回家呢？
[02:11.43]Last summer I spent days in the garden watching thousands of ants crawling up the trunk of my prize peach tree. | 去年夏天，我在花园里花了好几天时间，观察成千上万的蚂蚁爬上我那棵珍贵的桃树树干。
[02:20.64]The tree has grown against a warm wall on a sheltered side of the house. | 这棵树长在房子避风处的一面暖墙边。
[02:26.08]I am especially proud of it, | 我特别为它感到自豪，
[02:28.61]not only because it has survived several severe winters, but because it occasionally produces luscious peaches. | 不仅因为它熬过了好几个严酷的冬天，还因为它偶尔会结出甜美的桃子。
[02:39.08]During the summer, I noticed that the leaves of the tree were beginning to wither. | 夏天的时候，我注意到树叶开始枯萎了。
[02:45.01]Clusters of tiny insects called aphides were to be found on the underside of the leaves. | 树叶的背面可以发现成群的微小昆虫，叫做蚜虫。
[02:52.48]They were visited by a large colony of ants which obtained a sort of honey from them. | 一大群蚂蚁来访，从它们那里获取一种蜜露。
[02:59.12]I immediately embarked on an experiment which even though it failed to get rid of the ants kept me fascinated for twenty-four hours. | 我立即开始了一项实验，尽管它未能除掉蚂蚁，但却让我着迷了二十四个小时。
[03:10.00]I bound the base of the tree with sticky tape, making it impossible for the ants to reach the aphides. | 我用胶带缠住了树的底部，使蚂蚁无法接触到蚜虫。
[03:17.71]The tape was so sticky that they did not dare to cross it. | 胶带非常粘，它们不敢越过。
[03:22.59]For a long time, I watched them scurrying around the base of the tree in bewilderment. | 我长时间地看着它们困惑地在树底跑来跑去。
[03:29.59]I even went out at midnight with a torch and noted with satisfaction (and surprise) | 我甚至在午夜带着手电筒出去，满意地（也惊讶地）注意到
[03:36.88]that the ants were still swarming around the sticky tape without being able to do anything about it. | 蚂蚁仍然在胶带周围聚集，却无计可施。
[03:43.94]I got up early next morning hoping to find that the ants had given up in despair. | 第二天早上我早早起床，希望能看到蚂蚁已经绝望地放弃了。
[03:49.84]Instead, I saw that they had discovered a new route. | 结果，我发现它们开辟了一条新路线。
[03:54.31]They were climbing up the wall of the house and then on to the leaves of the tree. | 它们正在爬上房子的墙壁，然后爬到树叶上。
[03:59.58]I realized sadly that I had been completely defeated by their ingenuity. | 我伤心地意识到，我完全被它们的足智多谋打败了。
[04:05.79]The ants had been quick to find an answer to my thoroughly unscientific methods! | 蚂蚁很快就找到了应对我这种完全不科学的方法的办法！
