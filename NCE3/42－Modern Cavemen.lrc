[00:02.20]Modern cavemen | 现代穴居人
[00:09.46]With what does the writer compare the Gouffre Berger? | 作者把贝杰深洞与什么作比较？
[00:15.31]Cave exploration, or pot-holing, as it has come to be known, is a relatively new sport. | 洞穴探险，即人们所知的“探洞”，是一项比较新的运动。
[00:23.34]Perhaps it is the desire for solitude or the chance of making an unexpected discovery that lures people down to the depths of the earth. | 也许是出于对孤独的渴望，或是想作一次意想不到的发现，把人们引到地下去的。
[00:34.42]It is impossible to give a satisfactory explanation for a pot-holer's motives. | 想对探洞者的动机作出满意的解释是不可能的。
[00:40.92]For him, caves have the same peculiar fascination which high mountains have for the climber. | 对于他来说，洞穴有着与高山对于登山者一样的奇异魅力。
[00:48.99]They arouse instincts which can only be dimly understood. | 它们唤起人们只能模模糊糊感知到的本能。
[00:54.42]Exploring really deep caves is not a task for the Sunday afternoon rambler. | 勘探真正深的洞穴并非是周日下午散步者所能胜任的。
[01:00.19]Such undertakings require the precise planning and foresight of military operations. | 这种活动需要像军事行动一样精确的计划和预见性。
[01:08.04]It can take as long as eight days to rig up rope ladders and to establish supply bases before a descent can be made into a very deep cave. | 在下到一个很深的洞穴之前，光是架设绳梯和建立补给站就可能需要长达8天的时间。
[01:20.61]Precautions of this sort are necessary, for it is impossible to foretell the exact nature of the difficulties which will confront the pot-holer. | 这种预防是必要的，因为无法预知探洞者将会遇到的困难究竟是什么性质。
[01:32.06]The deepest known cave in the world is the Gouffre Berger near Grenoble. | 世界上已知最深的洞穴是格勒诺布尔附近的贝杰深洞。
[01:38.66]It extends to a depth of 3, 723 feet. | 它深达3723英尺。
[01:44.33]This immense chasm has been formed by an underground stream which has tunnelled a course through a flaw in the rocks. | 这个巨大的深渊是由一条地下河形成的，这条河在岩石的裂缝中开凿出一条通道。
[01:53.65]The entrance to the cave is on a plateau in the Dauphine Alps. | 洞口位于多芬阿尔卑斯山脉的一个高原上。
[02:00.13]As it is only six feet across, it is barely noticeable. | 由于洞口只有6英尺宽，所以几乎难以察觉。
[02:05.39]The cave might never have been discovered had not the entrance been spotted by the distinguished French pot-holer, Berger. | 如果不是杰出的法国探洞者贝杰发现了洞口，这个洞穴可能永远也不会被发现。
[02:15.00]Since its discovery, it has become a sort of pot-holers' Everest. | 自从被发现以来，它已成为探洞者们的一种“珠穆朗玛峰”。
[02:20.66]Though a number of descents have been made, much of it still remains to be explored. | 尽管已经进行过多次下降探险，但其中大部分仍有待勘探。
[02:27.85]A team of pot-holers recently went down the Gouffre Berger. | 一队探洞者最近下到了贝杰深洞。
[02:33.27]After entering the narrow gap on the plateau, | 他们进入高原上的那个狭窄的缝隙后，
[02:36.96]they climbed down the steep sides of the cave until they came to a narrow corridor. | 沿着洞穴陡峭的侧壁向下攀爬，直到来到一条狭窄的通道。
[02:43.62]They had to edge their way along this, | 他们不得不侧身沿着这条通道前行，
[02:46.29]sometimes wading across shallow streams, or swimming across deep pools. | 有时涉过浅浅的小溪，有时游过深深的水潭。
[02:52.62]Suddenly they came to a waterfall which dropped into an underground lake at the bottom of the cave. | 突然，他们来到一个瀑布，瀑布落入洞穴底部的一个地下湖中。
[03:00.69]They plunged into the lake, and after loading their gear on an inflatable rubber dinghy, let the current carry them to the other side. | 他们跳入湖中，把装备装到一艘充气橡皮艇上，然后让水流把他们带到对岸。
[03:11.67]To protect themselves from the icy water, they had to wear special rubber suits. | 为了保护自己不受冰冷湖水的侵袭，他们不得不穿上特制的橡胶衣。
[03:18.58]At the far end of the lake, they came to huge piles of rubble which had been washed up by the water. | 在湖的远端，他们遇到了被水冲刷而成的巨大碎石堆。
[03:26.87]In this part of the cave, they could hear an insistent booming sound | 在洞穴的这部分，他们能听到一种持续不断的轰鸣声，
[03:32.17]which they found was caused by a small waterspout shooting down into a pool from the roof of the cave. | 他们发现这是由一股小小的水柱从洞顶射入水潭所引起的。
[03:40.42]Squeezing through a cleft in the rocks, the pot-holers arrived at an enormous cavern, the size of a huge concert hall. | 探洞者们挤过岩石中的一道裂缝，来到一个巨大的洞穴，其大小相当于一个巨大的音乐厅。
[03:49.72]After switching on powerful arc lights, | 打开强光弧光灯后，
[03:53.00]they saw great stalagmites--some of them over forty feet high--rising up like tree-trunks to meet the stalactites suspended from the roof. | 他们看到了巨大的石笋——其中一些高达40多英尺——像树干一样向上生长，与悬挂在洞顶的钟乳石相接。
[04:05.43]Round about, piles of limestone glistened in all the colours of the rainbow. | 四周，一堆堆的石灰石闪耀着彩虹般的光芒。
[04:12.14]In the eerie silence of the cavern, the only sound that could be heard was made by water which dripped continuously from the high dome above them. | 在洞穴诡异的寂静中，唯一能听到的声音是头顶高高的拱顶不断滴落的水声。
