[00:17.94]The quiet life of the country has never appealed to me. | 宁静的乡村生活从来没有吸引过我。
[00:22.45]City born and city bred, | 我生在城里，长在城里，
[00:24.90]I have always regarded the country as something you look at through a train window, or something you occasionally visit during the weekend. | 始终认为乡村是透过火车车窗看的东西，或者至多是周末偶尔去逛逛的地方。
[00:35.61]Most of my friends live in the city, yet they always go into raptures at the mere mention of the country. | 我的大部分朋友都住在城里，然而他们一提到乡村就手舞足蹈。
[00:45.18]Though they extol the virtues of the peaceful life, | 尽管他们盛赞宁静生活的种种好处，

[01:35.95]My friend fails to mention the long and friendless winter evenings in front of the TV--virtually the only form of entertainment. | 我的朋友没有提到在电视机前度过的漫长而孤寂的冬夜——这几乎是唯一的娱乐方式。
[01:46.87]He says nothing about the poor selection of goods in the shops, | 他没有提及商店里商品的选择少得可怜，
[01:51.66]or about those unfortunate people who have to travel from the country to the city every day to get to work. | 也没有提及那些每天不得不从乡下到城里上班的可怜人。
[02:00.73]Why people are prepared to tolerate a four-hour journey each day for the dubious privilege of living in the country is beyond me. | 为什么人们愿意每天忍受4个小时的车程，只为享受住在乡下这种可疑的优待，这真是超出我的理解。

[04:17.67]obstinately pretend that they would prefer to live in the country. | 却固执地假装他们更喜欢住在乡下，这始终是个谜。
