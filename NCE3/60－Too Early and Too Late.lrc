[00:15.76]Punctuality is a necessary habit in all public affairs in civilized society. | 在文明社会中，准时是处理一切公共事务的必要习惯。
[00:23.31]Without it, nothing could ever be brought to a conclusion; everything would be in a state of chaos. | 没有它，任何事情都无法成功；一切都将处于混乱之中。
[00:31.53]Only in a sparsely-populated rural community is it possible to disregard it. | 只有在人口稀少的乡村社区，才有可能忽视它。
[00:38.44]In ordinary living, there can be some tolerance of unpunctuality. | 在日常生活中，对不准时可以有一些宽容。
[00:44.04]The intellectual, who is working on some abstruse problem, has everything coordinated and organized for the matter in hand. | 正在研究某个深奥问题的知识分子，会把手头的一切事物都协调组织好。
[00:53.53]He is therefore forgiven if late for a dinner party. | 因此，如果他赴晚宴迟到了，是可以被原谅的。
[00:58.07]But people are often reproached for unpunctuality when their only fault is cutting things fine. | 但人们常常因为不准时而受到指责，尽管他们唯一的过错只是把时间安排得太紧凑。
[01:05.63]It is hard for energetic, quick-minded people to waste time, | 对于精力充沛、头脑敏捷的人来说，浪费时间是很难的，
[01:10.47]so they are often tempted to finish a job before setting out to keep an appointment. | 所以他们常常想在赴约之前完成一项工作。
[01:16.25]If no accidents occur on the way, like punctured tyres, diversions of traffic, sudden descent of fog, they will be on time. | 如果路上没有发生意外，比如爆胎、交通改道、突如其来的大雾，他们就会准时到达。
[01:25.88]They are often more industrious, useful citizens than those who are never late. | 他们往往比那些从不迟到的人更勤劳、更有用。
[01:32.04]The over-punctual can be as much a trial to others as the unpunctual. | 过分准时的人和不准时的人一样，都会给别人带来麻烦。
[01:38.12]The guest who arrives half an hour too soon is the greatest nuisance. | 提前半小时到达的客人是最让人讨厌的。
[01:44.56]Some friends of my family had this irritating habit. | 我家里有些朋友就有这种令人恼火的习惯。
[01:48.32]The only thing to do was ask them to come half an hour later than the other guests. | 唯一的办法就是请他们比其他客人晚半小时来。
[01:54.09]Then they arrived just when we wanted them. | 这样他们就能在我们想要的时候到达。
[01:57.69]If you are catching a train, it is always better to be comfortably early than even a fraction of a minute too late. | 如果你要赶火车，最好是提前充足时间，而不是哪怕晚一分钟。
[02:05.97]Although being early may mean wasting a little time, | 尽管提前到达可能会浪费一点时间，
[02:09.57]this will be less than if you miss the train and have to wait an hour or more for the next one; | 但这比你错过火车，不得不等一个多小时才能搭乘下一班车要好；
[02:15.48]and you avoid the frustration of arriving at the very moment when the train is drawing out of the station and being unable to get on it. | 而且你还能避免那种火车正驶出车站而你却无法上车的沮丧。
[02:26.35]An even harder situation is to be on the platform in good time for a train and still to see it go off without you. | 更令人恼火的情况是，你准时到了站台，却眼睁睁看着火车没有你开走。

[02:42.72]She entered the station twenty minutes before the train was due, | 她在火车到站前20分钟就进了车站，
[02:47.20]since her parents had impressed upon her | 因为她的父母曾告诫她
[02:49.96]that it would be unforgivable to miss it and cause the friends with whom she was going to stay to make two journeys to meet her. | 错过火车是不可原谅的，那会让她要去拜访的朋友来接她两次。

[03:03.92]To her horror he said that she was two hours too soon. | 让她吃惊的是，他说她早来了两个小时。
[03:09.16]She felt in her handbag for the piece of paper on which her father had written down all the details of the journey and gave it to the porter. | 她从手提包里摸索出父亲写下所有旅行细节的纸条，交给了搬运工。
[03:18.85]He agreed that a train did come into the station at the time on the paper and that it did stop, but only to take on mail, not passengers. | 他承认火车确实在纸上写的时间到达车站，也确实停靠了，但那只是为了装载邮件，而不是载客。
[03:30.90]The girl asked to see a timetable, feeling sure that her father could not have made such a mistake. | 女孩要求看时刻表，她确信她父亲不可能犯这样的错误。
[03:38.29]The porter went to fetch one and arrived back with the station master, | 搬运工去拿时刻表，回来时带着站长，
[03:43.19]who produced it with a flourish and pointed out a microscopic 'o' beside the time of the arrival of the train at his station; | 站长得意地拿出时刻表，指出了他们车站火车到站时间旁边的一个微小的“o”；
