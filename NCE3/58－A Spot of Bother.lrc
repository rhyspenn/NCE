[00:02.48]A spot of bother | 一点麻烦
[00:09.52]What did the old lady find when she got home? | 老太太回家后发现了什么？
[00:14.73]The old lady was glad to be back at the block of flats where she lived. | 老太太很高兴回到她住的公寓楼。
[00:20.86]Her shopping had tired her and her basket had grown heavier with every step of the way home. | 购物让她感到疲惫，回家的每一步都让她手里的篮子变得更沉。
[00:28.27]In the lift her thoughts were on lunch and a good rest; | 在电梯里，她想着午餐和好好休息；
[00:32.65]but when she got out at her own floor, both were forgotten in her sudden discovery that her front door was open. | 但当她走出电梯到达自己的楼层时，她突然发现前门开着，午餐和休息都被抛到了脑后。
[00:42.07]She was thinking that she must reprimand her home help the next morning for such a monstrous piece of negligence, | 她心想，明天早上一定要训斥她的家政人员，因为她如此严重的疏忽，
[00:50.44]when she remembered that she had gone shopping after the home help had left and she knew that she had turned both keys in their locks. | 但她随即想起，家政人员离开后她才去购物，而且她确定自己把两把钥匙都锁好了。
[01:00.63]She walked slowly into the hall and at once noticed that all the room doors were open, | 她慢慢地走进门厅，立刻注意到所有的房门都开着，
[01:07.58]yet following her regular practice she had shut them before going out. | 然而按照她的习惯，出门前她都会关好门。
[01:12.69]Looking into the drawing room, she saw a scene of confusion over by her writing desk. | 往客厅里一看，她看到写字台附近一片混乱。
[01:19.28]It was as clear as daylight then that burglars had forced an entry during her absence. | 这时，她才明白，在她外出期间，窃贼破门而入了，这简直是明摆着的事。
[01:25.89]Her first impulse was to go round all the rooms looking for the thieves, | 她最初的冲动是把所有房间都找一遍，看看有没有小偷，
[01:31.23]but then she decided that at her age it might be more prudent to have someone with her, | 但后来她觉得，以她的年纪，找个人陪着会更稳妥，
[01:37.62]so she went to fetch the porter from his basement. | 于是她下楼去地下室找看门人。
[01:41.71]By this time her legs were beginning to tremble, so she sat down and accepted a cup of very strong tea, while he telephoned the police. | 这时她的双腿开始颤抖，于是她坐下来，喝了一杯很浓的茶，看门人则打电话报了警。
[01:52.27]Then, her composure regained, she was ready to set off with the porter's assistance to search for any intruders who might still be lurking in her flat. | 恢复镇定后，她在看门人的协助下准备出发，搜寻可能仍藏在她公寓里的不速之客。
[02:04.54]They went through the rooms, being careful to touch nothing, | 他们检查了各个房间，小心翼翼地不碰任何东西，
[02:08.73]as they did not want to hinder the police in their search for fingerprints. | 因为他们不想妨碍警方寻找指纹。
[02:13.88]The chaos was inconceivable. | 现场一片狼藉，简直难以置信。
[02:17.27]She had lived in the flat for thirty years and was a veritable magpie at hoarding: | 她在这间公寓住了三十年，是个名副其实的“喜鹊”，喜欢囤积物品：
[02:23.59]and it seemed as though everything she possessed had been tossed out and turned over and over. | 似乎她所有的东西都被翻了出来，翻了个底朝天。
[02:31.08]At least sorting out the things she should have discarded years ago was now being made easier for her. | 至少，现在整理那些她几年前就该扔掉的东西变得容易多了。
[02:38.73]Then a police inspector arrived with a constable and she told them of her discovery of the ransacked flat. | 随后，一名警督带着一名警员赶到，她向他们讲述了她发现公寓被洗劫一空的情况。
[02:47.15]The inspector began to look for fingerprints, while the constable checked that the front door locks had not been forced, | 警督开始寻找指纹，而警员则检查前门锁是否没有被撬，
[02:54.40]thereby proving that the burglars had either used skeleton keys or entered over the balcony. | 这证明窃贼要么使用了万能钥匙，要么是从阳台进入的。
[03:02.03]There was no trace of fingerprints, but the inspector found a dirty red bundle that contained jewellery which the old lady said was not hers. | 没有指纹痕迹，但警督发现了一个脏兮兮的红色包裹，里面装着珠宝，老太太说那不是她的。
[03:13.07]So their entry into this flat was apparently not the burglars' first job that day and they must have been disturbed. | 所以他们闯入这间公寓显然不是窃贼当天做的第一起案子，而且他们一定是在作案时受到了惊扰。
[03:21.84]The inspector then asked the old lady to try to check what was missing by the next day, | 警督随后要求老太太在第二天之前尽量清点一下丢失的物品，
[03:28.20]and advised her not to stay alone in the flat for a few nights. | 并建议她几晚不要独自待在公寓里。
[03:32.11]The old lady thought he was a fussy creature, | 老太太觉得他是个爱挑剔的人，
[03:36.47]but since the porter agreed with him, she rang up her daughter and asked for her help in what she described as a little spot of bother. | 但看门人也同意他的看法，于是她打电话给女儿，请她帮忙解决她所说的“一点小麻烦”。
