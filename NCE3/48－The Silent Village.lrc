[00:02.45]The silent village | 寂静的村庄
[00:10.01]Why was the village silent? | 村庄为什么寂静？
[00:14.61]In this much-travelled world, there are still thousands of places which are inaccessible to tourists. | 在这个人们频繁往来的世界上，仍然有成千上万个旅游者望而却步的地方。
[00:23.07]We always assume that villagers in remote places are friendly and hospitable. | 我们总是认为，住在偏远地方的村民是友好而殷勤好客的。
[00:29.74]But people who are cut off not only from foreign tourists, but even from their own countrymen can be hostile to travellers. | 但是，那些不仅与外国旅游者隔绝，甚至与本国同胞也隔绝的人们，却可能对旅游者怀有敌意。
[00:40.02]Visits to really remote villages are seldom enjoyable--as my wife and I discovered during a tour through the Balkans. | 访问真正偏僻的村庄，很少有什么乐趣可言——我和我妻子在巴尔干半岛旅行时就发现了这一点。
[00:48.81]We had spent several days in a small town and visited a number of old churches in the vicinity. | 我们在一个小镇上呆了几天，参观了附近的一些古老的教堂。
[00:56.13]These attracted many visitors, for they were not only of great architectural interest, but contained a large number of beautifully preserved frescoes as well. | 这些教堂吸引了许多旅游者，因为它们不仅有很高的建筑价值，而且还保存了大量的制作精美的壁画。
[01:07.95]On the day before our departure, several bus loads of tourists descended on the town. | 在我们动身的前一天，好几车游客涌入了小镇。
[01:14.50]This was more than we could bear, so we decided to spend our last day exploring the countryside. | 这太让我们受不了了，于是我们决定最后一天到乡下去。
[01:22.86]Taking a path which led out of the town, we crossed a few fields until we came to a dense wood. | 我们沿着一条从小镇延伸出去的小路，穿过几片田地，来到一片茂密的树林。
[01:30.38]We expected the path to end abruptly, but we found that it traced its way through the trees. | 我们本以为小路会突然中断，不料它却在树林中蜿蜒而行。
[01:38.22]We tramped through the wood for over two hours until we arrived at a deep stream. | 我们在树林里跋涉了两个多小时，来到一条很深的溪流前。
[01:44.54]We could see that the path continued on the other side, but we had no idea how we could get across the stream. | 我们看到小路在对岸延伸，但不知道怎样才能穿过溪流。
[01:53.50]Suddenly my wife spotted a boat moored to the bank. | 突然，我妻子发现了一条系在岸边的船。
[01:57.76]In it there was a boatman fast asleep. | 船上有一个船夫，睡得很熟。
[02:01.38]We gently woke him up and asked him to ferry us to the other side. | 我们轻轻地把他叫醒，请他把我们摆渡到对岸。
[02:06.67]Though he was reluctant to do so at first, we eventually persuaded him to take us. | 虽然他开始不情愿，但我们最终说服他带我们过去了。
[02:13.23]The path led to a tiny village perched on the steep sides of a mountain. | 小路通向一个坐落在陡峭山腰上的小村庄。
[02:19.39]The place consisted of a straggling unmade road which was lined on either side by small houses. | 这个地方只有一条弯弯曲曲的土路，两旁是些小房子。
[02:26.93]Even under a clear blue sky, the village looked forbidding, as all the houses were built of grey mud bricks. | 即使在晴朗的蓝天下，这个村庄看上去也令人望而生畏，因为所有的房子都是用灰色土坯建造的。
[02:36.09]The village seemed deserted, | 村庄似乎空无一人，
[02:38.49]the only sign of life being an ugly-looking black goat on a short length of rope tied to a tree in a field nearby. | 唯一的生命迹象是在附近的一块田地里，有一只拴在树上的黑山羊，它被短绳系着，面目丑陋。
[02:49.12]Sitting down on a dilapidated wooden fence near the field, we opened a couple of tins of sardines and had a picnic lunch. | 我们在田边一处破旧的木栅栏旁坐了下来，打开了两罐沙丁鱼罐头，吃起了野餐。
[02:58.85]All at once, I noticed that my wife seemed to be filled with alarm. | 突然，我注意到我妻子好像惊恐万状。
[03:04.72]Looking up I saw that we were surrounded by children in rags who were looking at us silently as we ate. | 我抬起头，看到我们已经被一群衣衫褴褛的孩子围住了，他们一言不发地看着我们吃东西。
[03:13.30]We offered them food and spoke to them kindly, but they remained motionless. | 我们给他们食物，和善地对他们说话，但他们仍然一动不动。
[03:19.93]I concluded that they were simply shy of strangers. | 我断定他们只是害羞，不愿见陌生人。
[03:24.12]When we later walked down the main street of the village, we were followed by a silent procession of children. | 后来我们沿着村里的主要街道走去，一群默默无声的孩子跟在我们后面。
[03:32.46]The village which had seemed deserted, immediately came to life. | 这个村庄，本来似乎空无一人，立刻变得活跃起来。
[03:38.24]Faces appeared at windows. | 窗户里出现了脸庞。
[03:40.40]Men in shirt sleeves stood outside their houses and glared at us. | 穿着衬衫的男人站在屋外，怒视着我们。
[03:45.78]Old women in black shawls peered at us from doorways. | 披着黑色披肩的老妇人从门道里窥视着我们。
[03:50.73]The most frightening thing of all was that not a sound could be heard. | 最令人恐惧的是，一点声音都听不到。
[03:56.64]There was no doubt that we were unwelcome visitors. | 毫无疑问，我们是不受欢迎的客人。
[04:01.54]We needed no further warning. | 我们不再需要更多的警告了。
[04:04.25]Turning back down the main street, | 我们转身沿着主要街道往回走，
[04:06.60]we quickened our pace and made our way rapidly towards the stream where we hoped the boatman was waiting. | 加快了脚步，迅速朝小溪走去，我们希望船夫还在那里等着。
