[00:16.81]The New Year is a time for resolutions. | 新年是制定决心的时候。
[00:19.91]Mentally, at least, most of us could compile formidable lists of 'dos' and 'don'ts'. | 至少在心理上，我们大多数人都能列出一长串“该做”和“不该做”的事情。
[00:27.54]The same old favourites recur year in year out with monotonous regularity. | 那些老掉牙的旧习惯年复一年地以单调的规律重现。
[00:34.27]We resolve to get up earlier each morning, eat less, | 我们下决心每天早起，少吃，
[00:38.35]find more time to play with the children, do a thousand and one jobs about the house, | 抽出更多时间陪孩子们玩，做成千上万件家务，

[00:51.73]Past experience has taught us that certain accomplishments are beyond attainment. | 过去的经验告诉我们，有些成就是无法实现的。
[00:57.86]If we remain inveterate smokers, it is only because we have so often experienced the frustration that results from failure. | 如果我们仍是老烟枪，那只是因为我们屡次体验了失败带来的挫折感。
[01:07.83]Most of us fail in our efforts at self-improvement because our schemes are too ambitious and we never have time to carry them out. | 我们大多数人在自我改进方面都失败了，因为我们的计划过于雄心勃勃，我们根本没有时间去实施。
[01:17.37]We also make the fundamental error of announcing our resolutions to everybody | 我们还犯了一个根本性的错误，那就是向所有人宣布我们的决心，
[01:23.01]so that we look even more foolish when we slip back into our bad old ways. | 这样当我们故态复萌时，就会显得更加愚蠢。
[01:29.20]Aware of these pitfalls, this year I attempted to keep my resolutions to myself. | 意识到这些陷阱，今年我试图把我的决心藏在心里。
[01:36.21]I limited myself to two modest ambitions: to do physical exercises every morning and to read more of an evening. | 我只限制自己两个适度的抱负：每天早上做体育锻炼，晚上多读书。
[01:46.61]An all-night party on New Year's Eve provided me with a good excuse for not carrying out either of these new resolutions on the first day of the year, | 新年前夜的通宵派对给了我一个很好的借口，让我在新年第一天没有执行这两项新决心，
[01:57.90]but on the second, I applied myself assiduously to the task. | 但在第二天，我勤奋地投入到这项任务中。
[02:03.67]The daily exercises lasted only eleven minutes and I proposed to do them early in the morning before anyone had got up. | 每天的锻炼只持续11分钟，我打算在大家起床之前一大早做。
[02:13.40]The self-discipline required to drag myself out of bed 11 minutes earlier than usual was considerable. | 要比平时早11分钟把自己从床上拽起来，需要的自律性是相当大的。
[02:21.74]Nevertheless, I managed to creep down into the living room for two days before anyone found me out. | 尽管如此，我还是设法偷偷溜到客厅里去了两天，才被人发现。
[02:31.03]After jumping about on the carpet and twisting the human frame into uncomfortable positions, | 在地毯上跳来跳去，把身体扭曲成不舒服的姿势之后，
[02:37.82]I sat down at the breakfast table in an exhausted condition. | 我筋疲力尽地坐到早餐桌旁。
[02:42.89]It was this that betrayed me. | 就是这个把我出卖了。
[02:45.78]The next morning the whole family trooped in to watch the performance. | 第二天早上，全家人都跑进来观看表演。
[02:50.51]That was really unsettling but I fended off the taunts and jibes of the family good-humouredly and soon everybody got used to the idea. | 这确实让人不安，但我还是好脾气地抵挡住了家人的嘲讽和揶揄，很快大家就习惯了。
[03:00.40]However, my enthusiasm waned. | 然而，我的热情消退了。
[03:03.85]The time I spent at exercises gradually diminished. | 我花在锻炼上的时间逐渐减少。
[03:07.67]Little by little the eleven minutes fell to zero. | 渐渐地，那11分钟变成了零。
[03:12.29]By January 10th, I was back to where I had started from. | 到了1月10日，我又回到了起点。
[03:17.33]I argued that if I spent less time exhausting myself at exercises in the morning, | 我辩解说，如果早上少花点时间在锻炼上把自己搞得精疲力尽，
[03:23.54]I would keep my mind fresh for reading when I got home from work. | 那么我下班回家时，头脑会更清醒，可以用来阅读。
[03:28.32]Resisting the hypnotizing effect of television, | 抵制住电视的催眠作用，
[03:32.16]I sat in my room for a few evenings with my eyes glued to a book. | 有几个晚上，我坐在房间里，眼睛紧盯着一本书。
[03:37.18]One night, however, feeling cold and lonely, I went downstairs and sat in front of the television pretending to read. | 然而，有一天晚上，我感到又冷又寂寞，于是下楼坐在电视机前假装看书。
[03:47.05]That proved to be my undoing, for I soon got back to my old bad habit of dozing off in front of the screen. | 那被证明是我的失败，因为我很快又回到了在屏幕前打瞌睡的旧习惯。
[03:57.32]I still haven't given up my resolution to do more reading. | 我还没有放弃多读书的决心。
[04:01.22]In fact, I have just bought a book entitled How to Read a Thousand Words a Minute. | 事实上，我刚买了一本名为《如何一分钟阅读一千字》的书。
[04:08.70]Perhaps it will solve my problem, but I just haven't had time to read it! | 也许它能解决我的问题，但我就是没时间读它！
