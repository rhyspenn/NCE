[00:22.41]In many ways, this is unfortunate for the poor actors who are required to go on repeating the same lines night after night. | 在许多方面，这对可怜的演员来说是不幸的，他们被要求夜复一夜地重复相同的台词。

[01:18.41]after so many performances, he had managed to learn the contents of the letter by heart. | 在这么多场演出之后，他是否已经把信的内容熟记于心。
[01:25.45]The curtain went up on the final act of the play and revealed the aristocrat sitting alone behind bars in his dark cell. | 戏剧的最后一幕拉开了帷幕，露出了贵族独自一人坐在漆黑牢房的铁窗后面。
[01:35.16]Just then, the gaoler appeared with the precious letter in his hands. | 就在那时，狱卒手里拿着那封珍贵的信出现了。
[01:40.55]He entered the cell and presented the letter to the aristocrat. | 他走进牢房，把信递给了贵族。
[01:45.36]But the copy he gave him had not been written out in full as usual. | 但他给他的那份信件并未像往常一样完整写出。

[01:54.14]The gaoler looked on eagerly, anxious to see if his fellow actor had at last learnt his lines. | 狱卒焦急地看着，渴望知道他的同事演员是否终于记住了台词。
[02:02.23]The noble stared at the blank sheet of paper for a few seconds. | 贵族盯着那张白纸看了几秒钟。

[02:20.49]Finding that he could not remember a word of the letter either, | 狱卒发现自己也记不住信里一个字，
[02:24.83]the gaoler replied: 'The light is indeed dim, sire. I must get my glasses. ' | 他回答说：“陛下，光线确实很暗。我必须去拿我的眼镜。”
[02:32.56]With this, he hurried off the stage. | 说完，他匆匆忙忙地下了台。
[02:36.38]Much to the aristocrat's amusement, | 令贵族非常有趣的是，
