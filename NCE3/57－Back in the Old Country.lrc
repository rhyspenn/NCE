[01:10.65]His roots and mine had become too firmly embedded in the new land. | 他和我的根基都已在新土地上扎得太深了。

[01:31.44]I hired a car the day after landing and bought a comprehensive book of maps, | 降落的第二天，我租了一辆车，买了一本详尽的地图册，
[01:36.93]which I found most helpful on the cross-country journey, but which I did not think I should need on the last stage. | 我发现这本地图册在跨国旅途中非常有用，但我不认为在最后一段路程中我还需要它。
[01:44.62]It was not that I actually remembered anything at all. | 并不是我真的记得任何东西。
[01:48.56]But my father had described over and over again what we should see at every milestone after leaving the nearest town, | 但父亲曾一遍又一遍地描述，离开最近的城镇后，每过一个里程碑我们会看到什么，

[02:18.39]I should be looking at farms and cottages in a valley, | 我应该能看到山谷里的农场和小屋，
[02:22.48]with the spire of the church of our village showing in the far distance. | 远处还能看到我们村教堂的尖顶。
[02:27.63]I could see no valley, no farms, no cottages and no church spire-only a lake. | 我看不到山谷，看不到农场，看不到小屋，也看不到教堂尖顶——只有一片湖。
[02:34.88]I decided that I must have taken a wrong turning somewhere. | 我断定我一定是在某个地方拐错了弯。
[02:39.19]So I drove back to the town and began to retrace the route, taking frequent glances at the map. | 于是我开车回到城镇，开始按原路返回，并不时地看一眼地图。
[02:46.44]I landed up at the same corner. | 我最终还是回到了同一个路口。
[02:49.18]The curious thing was that the lake was not marked on the map. | 奇怪的是，地图上并没有标示这片湖。
[02:53.27]I felt as if I had stumbled into a nightmare country, as you sometimes do in dreams. | 我感觉自己好像偶然闯入了一个噩梦般的国度，就像你在梦中有时会遇到的那样。
[02:59.55]And, as in a nightmare, there was nobody in sight to help me. | 就像在噩梦中一样，四周没有人能帮助我。

[03:22.51]I thought he must have misunderstood me, so I repeated its name. | 我以为他一定是误解了我的意思，所以我又重复了一遍村子的名字。
[03:28.08]This time he pointed to the lake. | 这次他指向了湖面。
[03:31.15]The village no longer existed because it had been submerged, and all the valley too. | 那个村子已经不复存在了，因为它连同整个山谷都被淹没了。
[03:38.49]The lake was not a natural one, but a man-made reservoir. | 那片湖不是天然形成的，而是一个人工水库。
