[00:18.55]The rough road across the plain soon became so bad that we tried to get Bruce to drive back to the village we had come from. | 穿过平原的崎岖道路很快变得非常糟糕，以至于我们试图让布鲁斯开车回到我们来时的村庄。

[00:37.64]Glancing at his map, he informed us that the next village was a mere twenty miles away. | 他扫了一眼地图，告诉我们下一个村庄只有区区二十英里远。
[00:45.62]It was not that Bruce always underestimated difficulties. | 并不是布鲁斯总是低估困难。
[00:49.76]He simply had no sense of danger at all. | 他根本就没有危险意识。

[01:02.58]As we bumped over the dusty track, we swerved to avoid large boulders. | 当我们在尘土飞扬的小路上颠簸时，我们猛打方向盘以避开大块巨石。
[01:08.47]The wheels scooped up stones which hammered ominously under the car. | 车轮卷起石子，在车底下发出不祥的敲击声。
[01:14.90]We felt sure that sooner or later a stone would rip a hole in our petrol tank or damage the engine. | 我们确信迟早会有石子把我们的油箱撕开一个洞或者损坏发动机。
[01:23.60]Because of this, we kept looking back, wondering if we were leaving a trail of oil and petrol behind us. | 因此，我们不停地回头看，想知道我们是否在身后留下了一串油迹和汽油。
[01:33.22]What a relief it was when the boulders suddenly disappeared, | 当巨石突然消失时，我们松了一口气，
[01:37.45]giving way to a stretch of plain where the only obstacles were clumps bushes. | 取而代之的是一片平坦的开阔地，那里唯一的障碍物是灌木丛。

[01:51.80]In response to renewed pleadings, Bruce stopped. | 布鲁斯响应我们再次的恳求，停了下来。
[01:56.77]Though we all got out to examine the fissure, he remained in the car. | 尽管我们都下车检查裂缝，他却仍然待在车里。
[02:02.09]We informed him that the fissure extended for fifty yards and was two feet wide and four feet deep. | 我们告诉他，那道裂缝绵延五十码，宽两英尺，深四英尺。

[02:14.88]Bruce went into a low gear and drove at a terrifying speed, | 布鲁斯挂入低档，以惊人的速度行驶，

[02:49.12]Bruce charged at it, but in the middle, the car came to a grinding halt. | 布鲁斯冲了过去，但在水池中央，汽车嘎然而止。
[02:55.96]A yellow light on the dashboard flashed angrily and Bruce cheerfully announced that there was no oil in the engine! | 仪表盘上一个黄灯愤怒地闪烁着，布鲁斯却高兴地宣布发动机里没油了！
