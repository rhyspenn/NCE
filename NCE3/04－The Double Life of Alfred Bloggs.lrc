[00:11.34]Why did Alf want a white-collar job? | 阿尔弗为什么想找份白领工作？
[00:16.83]These days, people who do manual work often receive far more money than people who work in offices. | 如今，从事体力劳动的人挣的钱，常常比办公室工作人员挣的钱多得多。
[00:24.76]People who work in offices are frequently referred to as 'white-collar workers' for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work. | 办公室工作人员通常被称为“白领工人”，原因很简单，他们上班时通常穿带领带的衬衫。
[00:36.74]Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers. | 人性如此，许多人常常愿意牺牲较高的工资，以换取成为白领工人的殊荣。
[00:48.19]This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation. | 这可能导致一些奇怪的情况，就像阿尔弗雷德·布洛格斯的情况一样，他曾是埃尔斯米尔公司的一名清洁工。

[01:07.63]He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation. | 他只告诉她他在公司上班。
[01:11.57]Every morning, he left home dressed in a smart black suit. | 每天早上，他都穿着一套漂亮的黑色西装出门。
[01:16.45]He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman. | 然后他换上工作服，接下来的八个小时都当清洁工。
[01:22.90]Before returning home at night, he took a shower and changed back into his suit. | 晚上回家前，他洗了个澡，又换回了他的西装。
[01:29.02]Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret. | 阿尔弗这样做了两年多，他的清洁工同事们都替他保密。
[01:35.66]Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found another job. | 阿尔弗的妻子从未发现她嫁给了一个清洁工，而且她永远也不会发现了，因为阿尔弗刚刚找到了另一份工作。
[01:44.47]He will soon be working in an office. | 他很快就要在办公室工作了。
[01:47.61]He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money. | 他挣的钱将只有以前的一半，但他觉得地位的提升，很值得损失这点钱。
[01:57.05]From now on, he will wear a suit all day and others will call him 'Mr.Bloggs', not 'Alf'. | 从现在起，他将一整天都穿西装，别人会称呼他“布洛格斯先生”，而不是“阿尔弗”。
