[00:02.55]Our neighbour, the river | 我们的邻居，河流
[00:09.41]Why had the neighbours left their farm? | 邻居们为什么离开了他们的农场？
[00:13.91]The river which forms the eastern boundary of our farm has always played an important part in our lives. | 构成了我们农场东部边界的河流，在我们的生活中一直扮演着重要的角色。
[00:21.26]Without it we could not make a living. | 没有它，我们就无法谋生。
[00:24.33]There is only enough spring water to supply the needs of the house so we have to pump from the river for farm use. | 泉水仅够供应房屋使用，所以农场用水必须从河里抽。
[00:32.59]We tell the river all our secrets. | 我们向河流倾诉我们所有的秘密。
[00:35.36]We know instinctively, just as beekeepers with their bees, | 我们本能地知道，就像养蜂人对他们的蜜蜂一样，
[00:39.98]that misfortune might overtake us if the important events of our lives were not related to it. | 如果我们生活中的重要事件不与河流相关，不幸可能会降临到我们身上。
[00:48.62]We have special river birthday parties in the summer. | 夏天我们会在河边举行特别的生日派对。
[00:52.63]Sometimes we go upstream to a favourite backwater, | 有时我们逆流而上到我们最喜欢的一个回水湾，
[00:56.49]sometimes we have our party at the boathouse, | 有时我们会在船屋举行派对，
[00:59.61]which a predecessor of ours at the farm built in the meadow hard by the deepest pool for swimming and diving. | 那是我们在农场的前任在草地边上，紧邻最深的游泳和跳水池建造的。
[01:07.74]In a heat wave we choose a midnight birthday party and that is the most exciting of all. | 在热浪来袭时，我们选择举行午夜生日派对，那是所有派对中最令人兴奋的。
[01:14.50]We welcome the seasons by the riverside, crowning the youngest girl with flowers in the spring, | 我们在河边迎接季节，春天给最小的女孩戴上花冠，
[01:21.08]holding a summer festival on Midsummer Eve, giving thanks for the harvest in the autumn, and throwing a holly wreath into the current in the winter. | 在仲夏夜举行夏季节庆，秋天感谢丰收，冬天则将冬青花环抛入水流中。
[01:32.66]After a long period of rain the river may overflow its banks. | 经过长时间的降雨，河流可能会泛滥。
[01:37.93]This is a rare occurrence as our climate seldom goes to extremes. | 这很少发生，因为我们这里的气候很少出现极端情况。
[01:43.11]We are lucky in that only the lower fields, | 我们很幸运，只有较低的田地，
[01:46.40]which make up a very small proportion of our farm, are affected by flooding, | 这只占我们农场很小的一部分，会受到洪水的影响，
[01:51.73]but other farms are less favourably sited, and flooding can sometimes spell disaster for their owners. | 但其他农场的位置不太好，洪水有时会给他们的主人带来灾难。
[02:00.33]One bad winter we watched the river creep up the lower meadows. | 一个糟糕的冬天，我们看着河水悄悄漫上了低洼的草地。
[02:06.04]All the cattle had been moved into stalls and we stood to lose little. | 所有的牛都已移入畜栏，我们几乎没什么损失。
[02:11.01]We were, however, worried about our nearest neighbours, whose farm was low lying and who were newcomers to the district. | 然而，我们担心我们最近的邻居，他们的农场地势低洼，而且他们是这个地区的新来者。
[02:20.08]As the floods had put the telephone out of order, we could not find out how they were managing. | 由于洪水导致电话失灵，我们无法了解他们的情况。
[02:26.30]From an attic window we could get a sweeping view of the river where their land joined ours, | 从阁楼窗户，我们可以俯瞰河流，看到他们的土地与我们农场相接之处，
[02:32.65]and at the most critical juncture we took turns in watching that point. | 在最关键的时刻，我们轮流守望那个地方。
[02:37.80]The first sign of disaster was a dead sheep floating down. | 灾难的第一个迹象是一只死羊顺流而下。
[02:42.99]Next came a horse, swimming bravely, | 接着来了一匹马，勇敢地游着，
[02:46.07]but we were afraid that the strength of the current would prevent its landing anywhere before it became exhausted. | 但我们担心水流太急，它在筋疲力尽之前无法靠岸。
[02:53.85]Suddenly a raft appeared, looking rather like Noah's ark, carrying the whole family, a few hens, the dogs, a cat, and a bird in a cage. | 突然，一个木筏出现了，看起来很像诺亚方舟，上面载着全家人、几只母鸡、狗、猫和一只笼子里的鸟。
[03:05.90]We realized that they must have become unduly frightened by the rising flood, | 我们意识到他们一定是过度被上涨的洪水吓到了，
[03:11.63]for their house, which had sound foundations, would have stood stoutly even if it had been almost submerged. | 因为他们的房子地基牢固，即使几乎被淹没，也能坚固地屹立不倒。
[03:20.42]The men of our family waded down through our flooded meadows with boat hooks, | 我们家的男人们带着船钩，趟过被淹没的草地，
[03:25.34]in the hope of being able to grapple a corner of the raft and pull it out of the current towrds our bank. | 希望能钩住木筏的一角，把它从水流中拉到我们这边的岸边。
[03:33.53]We still think it a miracle that they were able to do so. | 我们仍然认为他们能做到这一点是个奇迹。
